0,POSTER: How Distributed Are Today's DDoS Attacks?,https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2662382&preflayout=flat,November 2014,CCS '14: Proceedings of the 2014 ACM SIGSAC Conference on Computer and Communications Security,https://dl.acm.org/ft_gateway.cfm?id=2662382&ftid=1512480&dwn=1&CFID=160864435&CFTOKEN=c2c713ca164e64e2-09C23F89-E07A-49C7-D508CF0C99C1F49B,1,548,"Today botnets are responsible for most of the DDoS attacks on the Internet. Understanding the characteristics of such DDoS attacks is critical to develop effective DDoS mitigation schemes. In this poster, we present some preliminary findings, mainly concerning the distribution of the attackers, of today's DDoS attacks. Our investigation is based on 50,704 different Internet DDoS attacks collected within a seven-month period for activities across the globe. These attacks were launched by 674 botnet generations from 23 different bonet families with a total of 9026 victim IPs belonging to 1074 organizations that are collectively located in 186 countries. We find that different from the traditional widely distributed intuition, most of these DDoS attacks are not widely distributed as the attackers are mostly from the same region, i.e., highly regionalized. We also find that different botnet families have strong target preferences in the same area as well. These findings refresh our understanding on the modern DDoS attacks."

In the SG, the cyber elements of Wide Area Measurement Systems (WAMS) are deployed to provide the critical monitoring of the state of power transmission and distribution to accomplish real-time control of the grid. Unfortunately, the increasing adoption of such computing/communication cyber-technologies essential to providing the SG operations also opens the risk of the SG being vulnerable to cyberattacks. In particular, attacks such as Denial-of-Service (DoS) and Distributed DoS (DDoS) are of primary concern for WAMS where such attacks can compromise its safety-critical accuracy and responsiveness characteristics."

Many research efforts have been made with the purpose of proving the feasibility and the scalability of this proposal. Our main contribution is to provide an analysis of the Pending Interest Table memory requirements in real deployment scenarios, especially considering the impact of distributed denial of service attacks. In fact, the state that the protocol maintains for each resource request makes the routers more prone to resources exhaustion issues than in traditional stateless solutions. Our results are derived by using a full custom simulator and considering the different node architectures that have been proposed as valid reference models. The main outcomes point out differentiated weaknesses in each architecture we investigated and underline the need for improvements in terms of security and scalability."

As the volume of Internet traffic rapidly grows up, the current DDoS detection technologies have met a new challenge that should efficiently deal with a huge amount of traffic within the affordable response time. In this work, we propose a novel DDoS detection method based on Hadoop that implements a HTTP GET flooding detection algorithm in MapReduce on the distributed computing platform."
5,SENSS Against Volumetric DDoS Attacks,https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3274717&preflayout=flat,December 2018,ACSAC '18: Proceedings of the 34th Annual Computer Security Applications Conference,https://dl.acm.org/ft_gateway.cfm?id=3274717&ftid=2022466&dwn=1&CFID=160864435&CFTOKEN=c2c713ca164e64e2-09C23F89-E07A-49C7-D508CF0C99C1F49B,0,125,"Volumetric distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks can bring any network to a halt. Because of their distributed nature and high volume, the victim often cannot handle these attacks alone and needs help from upstream ISPs. Today's Internet has no automated mechanism for victims to ask ISPs for help in attack handling and ISPs themselves do not offer such services. We propose SENSS, a security service for collaborative mitigation of volumetric DDoS attacks. SENSS enables the victim of an attack to request attack monitoring and filtering on demand, and to pay for the services rendered. Requests can be sent both to the immediate and to remote ISPs, in an automated and secure manner, and can be authenticated by these ISPs, without having prior trust with the victim. Simple and generic SENSS APIs enable victims to build custom detection and mitigation approaches against a variety of DDoS attacks. SENSS is deployable with today's infrastructure, and it has strong economic incentives both for ISPs and for the attack victims. It is also very effective in sparse deployment, offering full protection to direct customers of early adopters, and considerable protection to remote victims when deployed strategically. Deployment on the largest 1% of ISPs protects not just direct customers of these ISPs, but everyone on the Internet, from 90% of volumetric DDoS attacks."
6,FlowJustifier: An optimized trust-based request prioritization approach for mitigation of SDN controller DDoS attacks in the IoT paradigm,https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3342037&preflayout=flat,July 2019,ICFNDS '19: Proceedings of the 3rd International Conference on Future Networks and Distributed Systems,https://dl.acm.org/ft_gateway.cfm?id=3342037&ftid=2082150&dwn=1&CFID=160864435&CFTOKEN=c2c713ca164e64e2-09C23F89-E07A-49C7-D508CF0C99C1F49B,0,9,"Software-defined networks have introduced innovative changes in communication networks by separating and centralizing control plane from the data forwarding plane, making the network more manageable and adaptable. SDN is widely getting adapted in the IoT environment mainly for the reason of security. Although SDN enhances network security with the centralized control of network behavior, it has its own challenges in terms of security. SDN controller is prone to DoS/DDoS attacks where attackers may flood controller with a large number of new flows beyond the controller's capacity, causing network failure for legitimate users. These attacks could be worse in the IoT context due to its open nature. A verity of techniques has been proposed for SDN controller attack mitigation, each could be categorized based on entropy, time, trust management and scheduling schemes used differently, but trust-based request prioritization solutions are simplest among these due to their resource requirements and less response time. Our proposed technique for mitigation of DDoS attacks is even based on trust management but specifically crafted for IoT environment that ensures maximal and optimal utilization of available resources, with the aim to reduce the load on the controller while making contest against attack more effective."

8,Maneuvering Around Clouds: Bypassing Cloud-based Security Providers,https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2813633&preflayout=flat,October 2015,CCS '15: Proceedings of the 22nd ACM SIGSAC Conference on Computer and Communications Security,https://dl.acm.org/ft_gateway.cfm?id=2813633&ftid=1630951&dwn=1&CFID=160864435&CFTOKEN=c2c713ca164e64e2-09C23F89-E07A-49C7-D508CF0C99C1F49B,7,739,"The increase of Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attacks in volume, frequency, and complexity, combined with the constant required alertness for mitigating web application threats, has caused many website owners to turn to Cloud-based Security Providers (CBSPs) to protect their infrastructure. These solutions typically involve the rerouting of traffic from the original website through the CBSP's network, where malicious traffic can be detected and absorbed before it ever reaches the servers of the protected website. The most popular Cloud-based Security Providers do not require the purchase of dedicated traffic-rerouting hardware, but rely solely on changing the DNS settings of a domain name to reroute a website's traffic through their security infrastructure. Consequently, this rerouting mechanism can be completely circumvented by directly attacking the website's hosting IP address. Therefore, it is crucial for the security and availability of these websites that their real IP address remains hidden from potential attackers. In this paper, we discuss existing, as well as novel ""origin-exposing"" attack vectors which attackers can leverage to discover the IP address of the server where a website protected by a CBSP is hosted. To assess the impact of the discussed origin-exposing vectors on the security of CBSP-protected websites, we consolidate all vectors into CloudPiercer, an automated origin-exposing tool, which we then use to conduct the first large-scale analysis of the effectiveness of the origin-exposing vectors. Our results show that the problem is severe: 71.5% of the 17,877 CBSP-protected websites that we tested, expose their real IP address through at least one of the evaluated vectors. The results of our study categorically demonstrate that a comprehensive adoption of CBSPs is harder than just changing DNS records. Our findings can steer CBSPs and site administrators towards effective countermeasures, such as proactively scanning for origin exposure and using appropriate network configurations that can greatly reduce the threat."

CPR-based approach has been proposed by Zhang et al. to detect and filter this kind of DDoS attacks, but its performance in terms of TCP throughput under attack is shown to be limited by the way it calculates CPR for each flow. In this paper, we will propose some modifications to the CPR-based approach in order to increase its performance. Simulation results show that the modifications can increase performance significantly."

It is a distributed attack in which an attacker uses a multitude of compromised computers to attack a single target. Those compromised computers that actually execute the attack are called botnet. To hide their identity, the attacker usually uses a third-party server to control and send attack command to bots, this kind of server is called C&C (command & control) server. The detection of C&C sessions is a strong proof of botnet detection and early detection of DDoS attacks as C&C connections occur before a DDoS attack. Network traffic analysis is an effective method to detect C&C sessions as it is hard to avoid encrypting the payload or change command code. We consider a new feature vector with 55 features, and use a random forest algorithm to build the classifier. Random forest is an ensemble of classifiers that can deal with high-dimension problems. In fact, it can also calculate the importance of features that will help us find the key features responsible for the detection of C&C sessions. Experimental results show that our approach has better performance on C&C session detection."

In this paper we describe two approaches to creating a DDoS engine out of a P2P system: the first involves poisoning the distributed index in the peers; the second involves poisoning the routing tables in the peers. For both approaches, the targeted host does not have to be a participant in the P2P system, and could be a web server, a mail server, or a user's desktop. We then examine these two poisoning attacks in Overnet, a popular DHT-based P2P file-sharing system. By using limited poisoning attacks of short duration on Overnet's indexing and routing tables, we create DDoS attacks against a targeted host. We find that with modest effort, both DDoS attacks can direct significant traffic from diverse peers to the target."

In September of 2016, Mirai software was used to infect more than 100,000 devices and unleash one of the largest distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks up to that time. After this incident, many people identified multiple large attacks coming from Internet of Things (IoT) devices, like CCTV cameras, and described these attacks as a new trend. A technique to detect whether a signal source is counterfeited in the initial stage of a DDoS attack is important. This paper proposes a method for the quick detection of a spoofed Internet protocol (IP) during a DDoS attack based on a DDoS shelter that is established to defend against DDoS attacks. In order to achieve this goal, we evaluate the number of time-to-live hops in normal traffic as a reference for the bandwidth of each network that is accessible to the DDoS shelter. In this study, we conduct an experiment using cases of actual DDoS attacks. As a result of this experiment, we prove that our proposed method quickly detects a spoofed IP."

We describe how mobile IP protocol in conjunction with our model can be used to deal efficiently with the attacks on mobile nodes."

Unfortunately there are several threats to these services. These threats are phishing, e-mail borne viruses, Trojan horse programs, Denial of Service etc. Among of them Distributed Denial of Service attack is a strong and more energetic attack on the Internet. Launching of DDoS attack is an explicit attempt to exhaust the resources of server to prevent legitimate users to access services. The common flooding DDoS attacks can be detected and mitigated by some mechanisms easily cause of the characteristics as flow rate, size of attack packets, but still it is difficult to detect and identifies the Low-Rate DoS attack because the attacker periodically send short burst packets which behave as legitimate traffic to the server. The attack is only detected when the server goes down. So an efficient detection system is required which effectively Characterize the legitimate and attack traffic to detect the attack and stop it to mitigate the effect of these sort of threats. In this article we proposed a complete framework for ""Characterization, Detection and Mitigation of Low-Rate DoS Attacks"" which effectively characterize the flows as attack or legitimate, detects the low-rate DoS attack on the basis of characteristics of low rate and mitigate the effect of this by stopping the attack flow near the source. The effectiveness of this approach have validated by simulation in ns-2, with Shell scripting, on a Linux platform."

It opens extra channels for information submission and remote control to our physical world. A significant feature of an IoT network is that it collects data from network edges. Moreover, human involvement for network and devices maintenance is greatly reduced, which suggests an IoT network need to be highly self-managed and self-secured. For the reason that the use of IoT is growing in many important fields, the security issues of IoT need to be properly addressed. Among all, Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) is one of the most notorious attacking behaviors over network which interrupt and block genuine user requests by flooding the host server with huge number of requests using a group of zombie computers via geographically distributed internet connections. DDoS disrupts service by creating network congestion and disabling normal functions of network components, which is even more disruptive for IoT. In this paper, a lightweight defensive algorithm for DDoS attack over IoT network environment is proposed and tested against several scenarios to dissect the interactive communication among different types of network nodes."

Focusing on the detection for such new DDoS attacks, a scheme based on document popularity is introduced. An Access Matrix is defined to capture the spatial-temporal patterns of a normal flash crowd. Principal component analysis and independent component analysis are applied to abstract the multidimensional Access Matrix. A novel anomaly detector based on hidden semi-Markov model is proposed to describe the dynamics of Access Matrix and to detect the attacks. The entropy of document popularity fitting to the model is used to detect the potential application-layer DDoS attacks. Numerical results based on real Web traffic data are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method."

The network layer is primarily concerned with routing. The packets may cross many networks to reach the destination during this process. To achieve its goals, the network layer must know about the topology, communication subnets and the version of the IP addresses used. The present version of IP is version 4 which must communicate with the next generation of IP addresses which is version 6. As both the versions of Internet Protocol must co-exist, we need some mechanisms that can help the transition process run smoothly. The old applications which are still using IP v4 should work smoothly with IP v6. We discuss IPv6 secure tunneling mechanism that has some advantages over the other models. The model discussed here can be used to establish hybrid communications between the two different versions of Internet protocol in both ways."

While on one hand the DNS protocol is relatively simple, the system has many moving parts, with multiple levels of caching and retries and replicated servers. This paper uses controlled experiments to examine how these mechanisms affect DNS resilience and latency, exploring both the client side's DNS user experience, and server-side traffic. We find that, for about 30% of clients, caching is not effective. However, when caches are full they allow about half of clients to ride out server outages that last less than cache lifetimes, caching and retries together allow up to half of the clients to tolerate DDoS attacks longer than cache lifetimes, with 90% query loss, and almost all clients to tolerate attacks resulting in 50% packet loss. While clients may get service during an attack, tail-latency increases for clients. For servers, retries during DDoS attacks increase normal traffic up to 8x. Our findings about caching and retries help explain why users see service outages from some real-world DDoS events, but minimal visible effects from others."

Our framework can be used to study diverse DDoS attack scenarios where multiple layers of protection are deployed and a number of uncertain factors affect the decision making of the players, and it also allows us to model different sophistication levels of reasoning by both the attacker and the defender. We conduct a variety of experiments to evaluate DDoS attack and defense scenarios where one or more layers of defense mechanisms are deployed, and demonstrate that our framework sheds light on the interplay between decision makings of both the attacker and the defender, as well as how they affect the outcomes of DDoS attack and defense games."

In this article we discuss two components of the technological solutions to DDoS attacks: cooperative filtering and cooperative traffic smoothing by caching. We then analyze the broken incentive chain in each of these technological solutions. As a remedy, we propose usage-based pricing and Capacity Provision Networks, which enable victims to disseminate enough incentive along attack paths to stimulate cooperation against DDoS attacks."

While on one hand the DNS protocol is relatively simple, the system has many moving parts, with multiple levels of caching and retries and replicated servers. This paper uses controlled experiments to examine how these mechanisms affect DNS resilience and latency, exploring both the client side's DNS user experience, and server-side traffic. We find that, for about 30% of clients, caching is not effective. However, when caches are full they allow about half of clients to ride out server outages that last less than cache lifetimes, caching and retries together allow up to half of the clients to tolerate DDoS attacks longer than cache lifetimes, with 90% query loss, and almost all clients to tolerate attacks resulting in 50% packet loss. While clients may get service during an attack, tail-latency increases for clients. For servers, retries during DDoS attacks increase normal traffic up to 8x. Our findings about caching and retries help explain why users see service outages from some real-world DDoS events, but minimal visible effects from others."

The network layer is primarily concerned with routing. The packets may cross many networks to reach the destination during this process. To achieve its goals, the network layer must know about the topology, communication subnets and the version of the IP addresses used. The present version of IP is version 4 which must communicate with the next generation of IP addresses which is version 6. As both the versions of Internet Protocol must co-exist, we need some mechanisms that can help the transition process run smoothly. The old applications which are still using IP v4 should work smoothly with IP v6. We discuss IPv6 secure tunneling mechanism that has some advantages over the other models. The model discussed here can be used to establish hybrid communications between the two different versions of Internet protocol in both ways."

This leads to the necessity of a good DDoS prevention and detection techniques. The paper aims to provide a better solution to these problems using features analysis. The statistical characteristics or parameters of the incoming packets viz. MTI (mean time intervals), POIP (probability of occurrence of IP), TTL (time to live), ACK value, SYN value, time stamp field, differentiated service field and sequence number are analyzed. The incoming packets are classified into normal and attack packets by deploying Naïve Bayes classifier algorithm using the attack and normal profile from previously available datasets. Information gain algorithm is used to decrease the computation time, memory usage and increase efficiency of detection by reducing the number of parameters. The performance increases with more consistency after the application of information gain. The efficiencies of detection before and after the application of information gain are 98% and 99.5% respectively. The computation time is also reduced by 46.6%.

Our specific focus is on pulsating attacks, a particularly debilitating type that has been hypothesized in the literature. In a pulsating attack, bots coordinate to generate intermittent pulses at target links to significantly reduce the throughput of TCP connections traversing the target. With pulsating attacks, attackers can cause significantly greater damage to legitimate users than traditional link flooding attacks. To date, however, pulsating attacks have been either deemed ineffective or easily defendable for two reasons: (1) they require a central coordinator and can thus be tracked; and (2) they require tight synchronization of pulses, which is difficult even in normal non-congestion scenarios. This paper argues that, in fact, the perceived drawbacks of pulsating attacks are in fact not fundamental. We develop a practical pulsating attack called CICADAS using two key ideas: using both (1) congestion as an implicit signal for decentralized implementation, and (2) a Kalman-filter-based approach to achieve tight synchronization. We validate CICADAS using simulations and wide-area experiments. We also discuss possible countermeasures against this attack."

Thus, the ability to filter spoofed IP packets near victim servers is essential to their own protection and prevention of becoming involuntary DoS reflectors. Although an attacker can forge any field in the IP header, he cannot falsify the number of hops an IP packet takes to reach its destination. More importantly, since the hop-count values are diverse, an attacker cannot randomly spoof IP addresses while maintaining consistent hop-counts. On the other hand, an Internet server can easily infer the hop-count information from the Time-to-Live (TTL) field of the IP header. Using a mapping between IP addresses and their hop-counts, the server can distinguish spoofed IP packets from legitimate ones. Based on this observation, we present a novel filtering technique, called Hop-Count Filtering (HCF)--which builds an accurate IP-to-hop-count (IP2HC) mapping table--to detect and discard spoofed IP packets. HCF is easy to deploy, as it does not require any support from the underlying network. Through analysis using network measurement data, we show that HCF can identify close to 90% of spoofed IP packets, and then discard them with little collateral damage. We implement and evaluate HCF in the Linux kernel, demonstrating its effectiveness with experimental measurements."

These attacks are particularly challenging, since attackers can use a limited amount of resources to trigger exhaustion of a particular type of system resource on the server side. SplitStack resolves this by splitting the monolithic stack into many separable components called minimum splittable units (MSUs). If part of the application stack is experiencing a DDoS attack, SplitStack massively replicates just the affected MSUs, potentially across many machines. This allows scaling of the impacted resource separately from the rest of the application stack, so that resources can be precisely added where needed to combat the attack. We validate SplitStack via a preliminary case study, and show that it outperforms naive replication in defending against asymmetric attacks."

Some highlights include: 1 geolocation analysis shows that the geospatial distribution of the attacking sources follows certain patterns, which enables very accurate source prediction of future attacks for most active botnet families; 2 from the target perspective, multiple attacks to the same target also exhibit strong patterns of inter-attack time interval, allowing accurate start time prediction of the next anticipated attacks from certain botnet families; and 3 there is a trend for different botnets to launch DDoS attacks targeting the same victim, simultaneously or in turn.

Due to scalability and economical reasons, SDN-WAN mostly uses an in-band control mechanism, which implies that control and data sharing the same critical physical links. However, the in-band control and centralized control architecture can be exploited by attackers to launch distributed denial of service (DDoS) on SDN control plane by flooding the shared links and/or the Open flow agents. Therefore, constructing a resilient software designed network requires dynamic isolation and distribution of the control flow to minimize damage and significantly increase attack cost. Existing solutions fall short to address this challenge because they require expensive extra dedicated resources or changes in OpenFlow protocol. In this paper, we propose a moving target technique called REsilient COntrol Network architecture (ReCON) that uses the same SDN network resources to defend SDN control plane dynamically against the DDoS attacks. ReCON essentially, (1) minimizes the sharing of critical resources among data and control traffic, and (2) elastically increases the limited capacity of the software control agents on-demand by dynamically using the under-utilized resources from within the same SDN network. To implement a practical solution, we formalize ReCON as a constraints satisfaction problem using Satisfiability Modulo Theory (SMT) to guarantee a correct-by-construction control plan placement that can handle dynamic network conditions."

This algorithm is used with throughput maximization as fitness function. In the testbed setup, we have evaluated the performance of SRD with Intelligent Waterdrop Algorithm (IWD) through simulation and observed that SRD needs about 40%--45% less number of iterations for convergence. The results shows that proposed method can mitigate DDoS attack with high accuracy and achieves more robustness."

We also propose countermeasures to contain such an attack. Our countermeasures include fee-based and age-based designs, which optimize the mempool size and help to counter the effects of DDoS attacks.

The goal of these attacks is to prevent legitimate users from accessing a website. Due to the nature of the attacks, the low rate, and the sophisticated imitation of user behavior from automated bots, it is difficult to diagnose these on time. There is an evolving 'industry' of blackmailing and using these attacks for illegal profit [1]. Even though L7 DDoS attacks are a serious threat, studying and experimenting with them is challenging. Organizations do not share server logs because of privacy concerns. Furthermore, implementing these attacks requires instrumentation and real testbeds in order to produce realistic attacks for analysis. Therefore, it is difficult to evaluate mitigation and detection techniques. Our contribution is twofold. First, we have developed a set of testbeds on the GENI (Global Environment for Network Infrastructure) cloud infrastructure [2] to facilitate research and development of detection and mitigation techniques of L7 DDoS attacks. Second, we have used a library of attacks to perform post forensic analysis and classify L7 DDoS attacks based on their individual characteristics. Our work automates and simplifies log generation of L7 DDoS attacks for research and experimentation, as well as provides criteria to detect abnormal requests using a library of attacks."

Under attack conditions, route anomalies are detected by determining which routers have been used for unknown source addresses, in order to construct the attack graph. Results of simulation studies are presented. Our approach does not require changes to the Internet routers or protocols. Precise information regarding the attack is not required allowing a wide variety of DDoS attack detection techniques to be used. Our algorithm is simple and efficient, allowing for a fast traceback and the scheme is scalable due to the distribution of processing workload."

We then dissect an active probing dataset, which reveals that the pool of amplifiers totaled 2.2M unique IPs and includes a small number of ""mega amplifiers,"" servers that replied to a single tiny probe packet with gigabytes of data. This dataset also allows us, for the first time, to analyze global DDoS attack victims (including ports attacked) and incidents, where we show 437K unique IPs targeted with at least 3 trillion packets, totaling more than a petabyte.

These benefits are fueled by innovations in orchestration of cloud platforms that make them totally programmable as Software Defined everything Infrastructures (SDxI). At the same time, sophisticated targeted attacks such as Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) are growing on an unprecedented scale threatening the availability of online businesses. In this paper, we present a novel defense system called Dolus to mitigate the impact of DDoS attacks launched against high-value services hosted in SDxI-based cloud platforms. Our Dolus system is able to initiate a 'pretense' in a scalable and collaborative manner to deter the attacker based on threat intelligence obtained from attack feature analysis in a two-stage ensemble learning scheme. Using foundations from pretense theory in child play, Dolus takes advantage of elastic capacity provisioning via 'quarantine virtual machines' and SDxI policy co-ordination across multiple network domains to deceive the attacker by creating a false sense of success. From the time gained through pretense initiation, Dolus enables cloud service providers to decide on a variety of policies to mitigate the attack impact, without disrupting the cloud services experience for legitimate users. We evaluate the efficacy of Dolus using a GENI Cloud testbed and demonstrate its real-time capabilities to: (a) detect DDoS attacks and redirect attack traffic to quarantine resources to engage the attacker under pretense, and (b) coordinate SDxI policies to possibly block DDoS attacks closer to the attack source(s)."

In this paper we propose a solution based on two principles -- 'distributed defense for distributed attack' and 'need for a preventive solution over a reactive solution'. We present a system architecture for distributed and predictive-preventive defense mechanism. We also propose two algorithms for systematic placement of the defense nodes in the victim's upstream router network. We compare the performance and efficiency of the proposed algorithms through simulation results. We also present an algorithmic approach for prediction of attack to determine the potential attackers as well as the time-to-saturation of victim. We present experimental evaluation to show the effectiveness of the proposed approach."

Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack as one of the most common form of attacks, has produced serious economic damages. DDoS attack detection as one of main defense methods is suffered increasing attention by researchers. Most of them use machine learning methods to make good detection performance. However, there are still gaps between real detection rate and expected one, conventional machine learning methods are limited compared with deep learning. In this paper, we propose DAD-MCNN, a multi-channel CNN(MC-CNN) based DDoS attack detection framework, which can fully utilize information from a huge amount of network packages and set up an earlier warning system. Our contributions can be summarized as follows: (1) we propose a new preprocessing method for the network dataset. (2) MC-CNN is applied to detect DDoS attack and the detection result is decided by data in respective channels. (3) We use incremental training method to optimize training procedures and time in MC-CNN. (4) The experiment result shows that MC-CNN has the highest accuracy compared with conventional machine learning methods. The result also proves that our approach has performed well not only in DDoS attack detection but also in other anomaly attack detection."

Volumetric attacks may target proxies while ""low volume"" attacks may target replicas. After reviewing existing and proposed defenses, such as changing proxy IP addresses (a ""moving target"" technique to combat the reconnaissance phase of the botnet) and fission of overloaded servers, we focus on evaluation of defenses based on shuffling client-to-server assignments that can be both proactive and reactive to a DDoS attack.

Such attacks are executed through the introduction of rogue devices and then using them and/or other compromised devices to facilitate DDoS attacks by generating relentless traffic. This paper aims to address DDoS security issues in IoT by proposing an integration of IoT devices with blockchain. This paper uses Ethereum, a blockchain variant, with smart contracts to replace the traditional centralized IoT infrastructure with a decentralized one. IoT devices are then required to access the network using smart contracts. The integration of IoT with Ethereum not only prevents rogue devices from gaining access to the server but also addresses DDoS attacks by using static resource allocation for devices."

The common objective in the existing solutions is to prevent the attacking traffic from reaching the servers by hiding the location of target server computers. The recent evolutions in DDoS attacks, especially in the increase in the number of bots involved in a DDoS attack and in the degree of control such bots have to the hijacked host computers, cause serious threats to the overlay-based solutions. We designed and assessed the potential of the new overlay-based security architecture that addresses the recent evolutions in DDoS attacks. The new security architecture, called ""Dynamic Binary User-Splits (DBUS)"", is designed to protect cloud servers (a) when their legitimate users convert to DoS/DDoS attackers or (b) when DDoS attacks are launched from the legitimate users' host computers that are hijacked by DDoS coordinators. DBUS copes with the situations by sieving attacking traffic from the hijacked legitimate users' host computers using dynamic binary user splits over the migrating entry points to an overlay network. Our discrete event driven simulation suggested that DBUS will efficiently sieve DDoS attacking hosts in many different situations, when a small number of attacking hosts hide behind a large legitimate user group, or when a stampede of DDoS attacking hosts occupy the majority of incoming traffic, without requiring a large number of migrating entry points. We also found that how quickly each migrating entry point can detect excess traffic is a key to keep convergence delay short."

We explore the applicability of game theoretic approaches to the cyber security problem with focus on active bandwidth depletion attacks. We model the interaction between the attacker and the defender as a two-player non-zero-sum game in two attack scenarios: (i) one single attacking node for Denial of Service (DoS) and (ii) multiple attacking nodes for Distributed DoS (DDoS). The defender's challenge is to determine optimal firewall settings to block rogue traffics while allowing legitimate ones. Our analysis considers the worst-case scenario where the attacker also attempts to find the most effective sending rate or botnet size. In either case, we build both static and dynamic game models to compute the Nash equilibrium that represents the best strategy of the defender. We validate the effectiveness of our game theoretic defense mechanisms via extensive simulation-based experiments using NS-3."

Although, various statistical measures can be used to construct profile of the traffic normally seen in the network to identify anomalies whenever traffic goes out of profile, we have selected volume and flow measure. Consideration of varying tolerance factors make proposed detection system scalable to the varying network conditions and attack loads in real time. NS-2 network simulator on Linux platform is used as simulation testbed. Simulation results show that our proposed solution gives a drastic improvement in terms of detection rate and false positive rate. However, the mammoth volume generated by DDoS attacks pose the biggest challenge in terms of memory and computational overheads as far as monitoring and analysis of traffic at single point connecting victim is concerned. To address this problem, a distributed cooperative technique is proposed that distributes memory and computational overheads to all edge routers for detecting a wide range of DDoS attacks at early stage."

A dataset of 11055 applications was also used, from which the two characteristics were extracted and entered into a classification algorithm. To this end, a Java application was developed for the classification of real users and those behind DDoS attacks. The results show that the proposed characteristics achieve an efficiency of 100%.

These attacks are particularly challenging since attackers using limited resources can exhaust the resources of even well-provisioned servers. DeDoS resolves this by splitting monolithic software stacks into separable components called minimum splittable units (MSUs). If part of the application stack is experiencing a DDoS attack, DeDoS can massively replicate only the affected MSUs, potentially across many machines. This allows scaling of the impacted resource separately from the rest of the application stack so that resources can be precisely added where needed to combat the attack. Our demonstration will show that DeDoS incurs reasonable overheads in normal operations and that it significantly outperforms naïve replication when defending against a range of asymmetric attacks."

In this paper we introduce IP Fast Hopping, effective network layer software solution against DDoS attacks. Our technology hides real IP address of a server behind a large pool of IP addresses belongs to a number of routers in different networks. Our method provides a network layer approach to prevent unauthorized access to a server that sometimes is important for the Internet of Things. Our approach implies real-time changing of server's IP address according to a schedule which is available only for authorized clients (so, our method is not applicable for publicly available Internet resources). This schedule is unique for each client connection and each entry in this schedule is being calculated dynamically on both edges of secured connection independently using a special pseudo-random function. To implement this requirement, during connection establishing between a new authorized client and the server, the client receives initial server's IP (which will be used for high level protocols on client side), pool of IP addresses (unordered set of IP address related to a set of ""edge"" routers) and unique session ID. The special network layer software installed on client's terminal changes destination IP address of the packet on an address from the IP pool according to value of a special pseudo-random function with the following arguments: session unique ID and time of packet's creation (value of timestamp field into TCP header). After that, this packet is being traversed to one of ""edge"" routers according to common switching protocols. The router checks (using the same pseudo-random function) that destination address is correct and, if yes, redirects this packet to real server IP or, otherwise, drops the packet. The same procedure is applied for server's responses to clients."

Typically, the malicious user directs the attack towards the network layer, especially the controller plane which acts as the core of the network. However, the attack is redirected to the application layer when the attacker is defeated in the network layer. This paper proposes to extend the SDN controller with an external device to improve the SDN architecture and to protect the service level of the SDN components against malicious attacks. Simulation results show that the proposal successfully protects Web servers against Slow HTTP DDoS attacks."

The biggest attacks can paralyze even large-scale infrastructures of worldwide companies. Attack mitigation is a complex issue studied by many researchers and security companies. While several approaches were proposed, there is still space for improvement. This paper proposes to augment existing mitigation heuristic with knowledge of reputation score of network entities. The aim is to find a way to mitigate malicious traffic present in DDoS amplification attacks with minimal disruption to communication of legitimate traffic."

The analysis is significant as the rate of increase of DDOS attacks has been increasing over the past few years and no effective system has yet been developed to safeguard our systems against potential attackers. It presents a highlight of the challenges, which are caused by these attacks, and discusses the various scenarios of tackling them. It recognizes the limitation and strengths of each strategy, which have been introduced thus far to combat DDOS attacks. This paper provides the existing countermeasures under one roof and discusses the effectiveness of each methodology. This survey will help in the further development of measures to reduce and eventually prevent DDOS attacks, thereby making the Internet a more secure network. This paper analyzes and reviews various methods used to mitigate distributed denial of service (DDOS) attacks by using load balanced hadoop clustering mechanism to filter HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) requests to avoid and fight against DDOS attacks."
94,BASE: an incrementally deployable mechanism for viable IP spoofing prevention,https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1229293&preflayout=flat,March 2007,"ASIACCS '07: Proceedings of the 2nd ACM symposium on Information, computer and communications security",https://dl.acm.org/ft_gateway.cfm?id=1229293&ftid=422126&dwn=1&CFID=160864435&CFTOKEN=c2c713ca164e64e2-09C23F89-E07A-49C7-D508CF0C99C1F49B,7,618,"DoS attacks use IP spoofing to forge the source IP address of packets, and thereby hide the identity of the source. This makes it hard to defend against DoS attacks, so IP spoofing will still be used as an aggressive attack mechanism even under distributed attack environment. While many IP spoofing prevention techniques have been proposed, none have achieved widespread real-world use. One main reason is the lack of properties favoring incremental deployment, an essential component for the adoption of new technologies. A viable solution needs to be not only technically sound but also economically acceptable. An incrementally deploy-able protocol should have three properties: initial benefits for early adopters, incremental benefits for subsequent adopters, and effectiveness under partial deployment. Since no previous anti-spoofing solution satisfies all three of these properties, we propose a new mechanism called ""BGP Anti-Spoofing Extension"" (BASE). The BASE mechanism is an anti-spoofing protocol designed to fulfill the incremental deployment properties necessary for adoption in current Internet environments. Based on simulations we ran using a model of Internet AS connectivity, BASE shows desirable IP spoofing prevention capabilities under partial deployment. We find that just 30% deployment can drop about 97% of attack packets. Therefore, BASE not only provides adopters' benefit but also outperforms previous anti-spoofing mechanisms."

The Domain Name System (DNS) is part of the core of the Internet and a crucial factor in the successful delivery of Internet services. Because of the importance of DNS, specialist service providers have sprung up in the market, that provide managed DNS services. One of their key selling points is that they protect DNS for a domain against DDoS attacks. But what if such a service becomes the target of a DDoS attack, and that attack succeeds?"

However, as the number, scale, and diversity of distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack is dramatically escalated in recent years, the availability of those platforms is still under risk. We note that the state-of-art DDoS protection architectures did not fully utilize the potential of SDN and network function virtualization (NFV) to mitigate the impact of attack traffic on data center network. Therefore, in this paper, we exploit the flexibility of SDN and NFV to propose FlexProtect, a flexible distributed DDoS protection architecture for multi-tenant data centers. In FlexProtect, the detection virtual network functions (VNFs) are placed near the service provider and the defense VNFs are placed near the edge routers for effectively detection and avoid internal bandwidth consumption, respectively. Based on the architecture, we then propose FP-SYN, an anti-spoofing SYN flood protection mechanism. The emulation and simulation results with real-world data demonstrates that, compared with the traditional approach, the proposed architecture can significantly reduce 46% of the additional routing path and save 60% internal bandwidth consumption. Moreover, the proposed detection mechanism for anti-spoofing can achieve 98% accuracy."

Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks can make IdM operations unavailable, preventing the use of computational resources by legitimate users. This work presents SAMOS, a novel Scheme for DoS Attacks Mitigation by the reOrganization and optimization of the IdM System. SAMOS optimizes the reorganization of the IdM system components founded on optimization techniques, minimizing DoS effects and improving the system lifetime. Results considering data from a real IdM system indicate the scheme viability and benefits."

DDoS attacks are among the most common and most devastating threats that network defenders have to watch out for. DDoS attacks are becoming bigger, more frequent, and more sophisticated. Volumetric attacks are the most common types of DDoS attacks. A DDoS attack is considered volumetric, or high-rate, when within a short period of time it generates a large amount of packets or a high volume of traffic. High-rate attacks are well-known and have received much attention in the past decade; however, despite several detection and mitigation strategies have been designed and implemented, high-rate attacks are still halting the normal operation of information technology infrastructures across the Internet when the protection mechanisms are not able to cope with the aggregated capacity that the perpetrators have put together. With this in mind, the present paper aims to propose and test a distributed and collaborative architecture for online high-rate DDoS attack detection and mitigation based on an in-memory distributed graph data structure and unsupervised machine learning algorithms that leverage real-time streaming data and analytics. We have successfully tested our proposed mechanism using a real-world DDoS attack dataset at its original rate in pursuance of reproducing the conditions of an actual large scale attack."

Since the attackers have developed different techniques and methods, preventing DDoS attacks has become more difficult. Traditional firewall is ineffective in preventing DDoS attacks. In this paper, we propose a new type of firewall named XFirewall to defend against DDoS attacks. XFirewall is a temporary firewall and is created when an attack occurs. Also, XFirewall will be configured with dynamic rules based on real-time traffic analysis. We will discuss in detail the design and algorithm for generating an XFirewall."
