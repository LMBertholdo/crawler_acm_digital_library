0,"Most of the problems facing the designers of a public cloud are extensions of what we face in any data center: detecting and preventing intrusions, coping with DoS attacks, and keeping the various services largely isolated from one another. There are some new challenges: how to control the behavior of customers when your privacy guarantees prevent you from looking too closely at what they are doing, how to protect them from network based attacks when you don't know what kind of traffic is normal, and how to guarantee them resources when the behavior of others sharing the hardware is unpredictable. There are also some new advantages: centrally managing software maintenance can assure that patches are installed promptly, and scale permits a permanent staff of experienced trouble shooters to handle what would be rare problems for any individual customer.",https://dl.acm.org/ft_gateway.cfm?id=2046668&ftid=1047106&dwn=1&CFID=84020132&CFTOKEN=a6f8f8e912c797a3-8C549BFF-CC18-FBDE-FEB65C7292D379D9,https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2046668&preflayout=flat,0,"2,103",October 2011,What's different about security in a public cloud?,CCSW '11: Proceedings of the 3rd ACM workshop on Cloud computing security workshop
1,"Cloud computing has become increasingly popular and important. Many companies have policy initiatives encouraging or even mandating the use of ""cloud"" computing. The popularity of cloud computing stems primarily from the hope for significant cost savings but also from the ability to scale quickly without large capital expenditures and efficient sharing and curation of very large data sets (for example, search indexes). Clouds, like distributed computing generally, also offers the ability to access data and resources from any connected device (increasingly mobile devices like smart phones and lightweight tablets like iPads). However, cloud computing in all its incarnations (Infrastructure as a Service, Software as a Service, Platform as a Service) raises a number of security questions that current providers have not addressed (or remain ominously silent about): increased susceptibility to insider attacks due to concentration of valuable data, ""fate-sharing"" and other vulnerabilities due to multi-tenancy, policy issues arising from multi-jurisdictional siting, vulnerabilities arising from scale operations, the opacity of cloud operators security practices and disclosure of interruption of operations or attacks. Despite these potential issues, cloud computing can be beneficial with judicial and transparent application of some simple security principles. We discuss cloud infrastructure, economics, operations and security infrastructure desiderata.",https://dl.acm.org/ft_gateway.cfm?id=2046662&ftid=1047102&dwn=1&CFID=84020132&CFTOKEN=a6f8f8e912c797a3-8C549BFF-CC18-FBDE-FEB65C7292D379D9,https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2046662&preflayout=flat,0,845,October 2011,Clouds and their discontents,CCSW '11: Proceedings of the 3rd ACM workshop on Cloud computing security workshop

3,"Cloud computing is a long fantasized visualization of computing as a utility, where data owners can remotely store and access their data in the cloud anytime and from anywhere. Using a shared pool of configurable resources, users can be relieved from the burden of local data storage and upkeep. The security of cloud computing has always been an important aspect of quality of service from cloud service providers. However, cloud computing poses many new security challenges which have not been well investigated. This paper provides an analysis of cloud computing, cloud data storage security, the security risks that involve using the cloud, security policies, physical security, and software security pertaining to the cloud.

5,"Auditing message exchange in a cloud involves logging interactions between services that are dynamically composed to satisfy a client's request to the cloud. Additional cloud management services are needed to facilitate audit record capture of events occurring within the end-to-end round trip messaging of the composition and to analyze the resulting audit assets for security anomalies. When an external cloud, possibly in a federation, has a service needed for the task, audit assets must be conveyed back to the originating cloud for disclosure of communications and resource accesses. Otherwise, the external cloud may hide any potential vulnerabilities related to information tainting, message attacks, and resource misuse since these security risks cannot be directly assessed. In this paper, we underscore the importance of designing cross-cloud communications to retain security audit information to assess message and resource vulnerabilities and maintain federation trust.

6,"Due to the many advantages offered by the cloud computing paradigm, it is fast becoming an enabling technology for many organizations, and even individual users. Flexibility and availability are two of the most important features that promote the wide spread adoption of this technology. In cloud-based data storage scenarios, where the data is controlled by a third party (i.e. the cloud service provider), the data owner usually does not have full control of its data at all stages. Consequently, this poses a prime security threat, and a major challenge is the development of a secure protocol for data storage, sharing, and retrieval. In recent years, a number of research works have targeted this problem. In this paper, we discuss some of the major approaches for secure data sharing in the cloud computing environment. The goal is to provide a concise survey of existing solutions, discuss their benefits, and point out any shortcomings for future research. Specifically, we focus on the use of encryption schemes, and provide a comparative study of the major schemes, through implementation of some representative frameworks.",https://dl.acm.org/ft_gateway.cfm?id=2668278&ftid=1505206&dwn=1&CFID=84020132&CFTOKEN=a6f8f8e912c797a3-8C549BFF-CC18-FBDE-FEB65C7292D379D9,https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2668278&preflayout=flat,1,417,September 2014,An Experimental Evaluation of Data Confidentiality Measures on the Cloud,MEDES '14: Proceedings of the 6th International Conference on Management of Emergent Digital EcoSystems

9,"Enforcing security properties in a Cloud is a difficult task, which requires expertise. However, it is not the only security-related challenge met by a company migrating to a Cloud environment. Indeed, the tenant must also have assurance that the requested security properties have effectively been enforced. Therefore, the Cloud provider has to offer a way of monitoring the security. In this paper, we present a solution to express the assurance properties based on the security requirements of the tenant and to deploy these assurance properties. First, we introduce a language that expresses the assurance based on the tenant's security requirements. Secondly, we propose an infrastructure that deploys the assurance in a Cloud environment. This solution aims to be easy to use: the assurance directly results from the high-level expression of the tenant's security requirements, and no additional action is needed from the tenant. Consequently, we address one of the greatest drawback of security and assurance - the complexity of their configuration - while providing a complete assurance mechanism.",https://dl.acm.org/ft_gateway.cfm?id=2752500&ftid=1589456&dwn=1&CFID=84020132&CFTOKEN=a6f8f8e912c797a3-8C549BFF-CC18-FBDE-FEB65C7292D379D9,https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2752500&preflayout=flat,0,214,June 2015,An Autonomic Cloud Management System for Enforcing Security and Assurance Properties,CLHS '15: Proceedings of the 2015 Workshop on Changing Landscapes in HPC Security

The architecture combines best practices in cryptography and security protocols with novel approaches to offer high security while providing good usability and performance. More than two years of successful operation with many satisfied customers and no security incidents demonstrate the soundness of the architecture. In addition to granting insight into the security architecture of a field-proven service to provide inputs for other services that have similar requirements, there's another motivation for this paper: We believe that to increase trust in cloud services, service providers should be more open about internal security details -- although this is in contrast to what typical cloud service providers do today.",https://dl.acm.org/ft_gateway.cfm?id=2181197&ftid=1198535&dwn=1&CFID=84020132&CFTOKEN=a6f8f8e912c797a3-8C549BFF-CC18-FBDE-FEB65C7292D379D9,https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2181197&preflayout=flat,0,261,April 2012,SecureSafe: a highly secure online data safe industrial use case,"MPM '12: Proceedings of the First Workshop on Measurement, Privacy, and Mobility"
11,"In modern days, use of service-oriented architecture (SoA) is becoming popular due to the use of public cloud. A cloud can provide storage services, computing services and infrastructure without any capital or operational expenditure. From a single user to a multi-national million dollar business can easily receive several types of services from a public cloud. There are numerous cloud providers in the market. Among the prominent ones, such as Amazon AWS, Google Cloud Platform (GCP), and Microsoft Azure etc. GCP offers a wide array of services for many organizations and individuals around the world like other cloud providers. However, the question is, all those data, confidential information, intellectual property of individual or industries safe enough? Information has become the most expensive commodity in modern days. A government can be shutdown, a transport system can be disabled, annoying spam calls, phishing emails, cyber bullying and more security threats exist around us. Can we trust a public service provider? Hence, our initiative aims at investigating that GCP is secure from inside attackers. Why we chose inside attackers? Well the idea is to check if GCP can detect and ignore an attack launched internally. In this case, it should be secure enough to prevent from outsiders as well. The research investigation would involve Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks against a local virtual machine (VM) launched from GCP.

TrustDraw improves security by allowing access to the critical data only if certain previously defined conditions are met. This way, the stealing of critical data by bypassing access permissions based on successfully executed attacks can be mitigated. TrustDraw runs isolated and transparent.

We show policy injection, a novel algorithmic complexity attack that enables a tenant to add specially tailored ACLs into the data center fabric to mount a denial-of-service attack through exploiting the built-in security mechanisms of the cloud management systems (CMS). Our insight is that certain ACLs, when fed with special covert packets by an attacker, may be very difficult to evaluate, leading to an exhaustion of cloud resources. We show how a tenant can inject seemingly harmless ACLs into the cloud data plane to abuse an algorithmic deficiency in the most popular cloud hypervisor switch, Open vSwitch, and reduce its effective peak performance by 80--90%, and, in certain cases, denying network access altogether.",https://dl.acm.org/ft_gateway.cfm?id=3234250&ftid=1992994&dwn=1&CFID=84020132&CFTOKEN=a6f8f8e912c797a3-8C549BFF-CC18-FBDE-FEB65C7292D379D9,https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3234250&preflayout=flat,2,158,August 2018,Policy Injection: A Cloud Dataplane DoS Attack,SIGCOMM '18: Proceedings of the ACM SIGCOMM 2018 Conference on Posters and Demos

25,"There is an increasing use of cloud computing in information technology (IT) with the widening scope of cloud computing. However, some service owners are reluctant to adopt cloud computing because the associated security technologies have not yet matured. Cloud service providers need to invest in security to improve the use of cloud computing. Additionally, research on the security investment in cloud computing is still in its early stages; due to the lack of related work, most companies or organizations should not provide an unlimited budget for security investment. Therefore, we devised an optimal investment scheme for constructing cloud security services that considers budget and the features of cloud computing services. This scheme includes an evaluation of security vulnerabilities concerning potential security attacks, and we performed an evaluation of a security investment strategy based on attack tree map (ATM) that analyze cloud security threat and vulnerabilities.

26,"Various classifications have been proposed to describe and organize the cloud security landscape. While some are inherited from general security concepts like security attributes (confidentiality, integrity, and availability), others are based on cloud specific characteristics such as cloud service models and stakeholders' roles.

This paper presents a comprehensive survey of the existing cloud computing security classifications, taxonomies, and ontologies. We explore their strengths, limitations, and effective use in an attempt to draw the general properties for a holistic framework that can provide a comprehensive view of cloud computing security and help better understand this evolving field.

Faced with multiple threats and heterogeneous defense mechanisms, the autonomic approach proposes simpler, stronger, and more efficient cloud security management. Yet, previous solutions fall at the last hurdle as they overlook key features of the cloud, by lack of flexible security policies, cross-layered defense, multiple control granularities, and open security architectures. This paper presents VESPA, a self-protection architecture for cloud infrastructures overcoming such limitations. VESPA is policy-based, and regulates security at two levels, both within and across infrastructure layers. Flexible coordination between self-protection loops allows enforcing a rich spectrum of security strategies such as cross-layer detection and reaction. A multi-plane extensible architecture also enables simple integration of commodity detection and reaction components. Evaluation of a VESPA implementation shows that the design is applicable for effective and flexible self-protection of cloud infrastructures.",https://dl.acm.org/ft_gateway.cfm?id=2371564&ftid=1291762&dwn=1&CFID=84020132&CFTOKEN=a6f8f8e912c797a3-8C549BFF-CC18-FBDE-FEB65C7292D379D9,https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2371564&preflayout=flat,3,466,September 2012,VESPA: multi-layered self-protection for cloud resources,ICAC '12: Proceedings of the 9th international conference on Autonomic computing

33,"Deduplication is a technique used to reduce the amount of storage needed by service providers. It is based on the intuition that several users may want (for different reasons) to store the same content. Hence, storing a single copy of these files is sufficient. Albeit simple in theory, the implementation of this concept introduces many security risks. In this paper we address the most severe one: an adversary (who possesses only a fraction of the original file, or even just partially colluding with a rightful owner) claiming to possess such a file. The paper's contributions are manifold: first, we introduce a novel Proof of Ownership (POW) scheme that has all features of the state-of-the-art solution while incurring only a fraction of the overhead experienced by the competitor; second, the security of the proposed mechanisms relies on information theoretical (combinatoric) rather than computational assumptions; we also propose viable optimization techniques that further improve the scheme's performance.

34,"Proofs of Retrievability (POR) are cryptographic proofs which provide assurance to a single tenant (who creates tags using his secret material) that his files can be retrieved in their entirety. However, POR schemes completely ignore storage-efficiency concepts, such as multi-tenancy and data deduplication, which are being widely utilized by existing cloud storage providers. Namely, in deduplicated storage systems, existing POR schemes would incur an additional overhead for storing tenants' tags which grows linearly with the number of users deduplicating the same file. This overhead clearly reduces the (economic) incentives of cloud providers to integrate existing POR/PDP solutions in their offerings. In this paper, we propose a novel storage-efficient POR, dubbed SPORT, which transparently supports multi-tenancy and data deduplication. More specifically, SPORT enables tenants to securely share the same POR tags in order to verify the integrity of their deduplicated files. By doing so, SPORT considerably reduces the storage overhead borne by cloud providers when storing the tags of different tenants deduplicating the same content. We show that SPORT resists against malicious tenants/cloud providers (and against collusion among a subset of the tenants and the cloud). Finally, we implement a prototype based on SPORT, and evaluate its performance in a realistic cloud setting.

The advantages of cloud computing are lucrative for well-established organizations looking to reduce infrastructure cost overheads. However, the users are not quite confident in entrusting their data to the cloud due to security threats and risks perceived in the cloud domain. Issues involving privacy requirements for the cloud and best practices in the cloud are suggested in this paper. Although the cloud provider ensures security in the cloud yet the flow of data, storage location, data computing process and security breaches are not transparent to the cloud customer. This distrust and lack of control on data is a major hindrance for potential cloud customers in adopting the cloud models for their businesses. Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs) are widely used to detect malicious activities. However existing solutions with IDSs involving DDoS and other non-detectable events may not be suitable in applying to the cloud due to distributed data storage and a major shift in Internet access mechanisms offered by cloud providers. Hence there is a strong need to analyze an appropriate IDS to counter DDoS attacks in the cloud.

In this paper, we propose a novel storage solution, ClearBox, which allows a storage service provider to transparently attest to its customers the deduplication patterns of the (encrypted) data that it is storing. By doing so, ClearBox enables cloud users to verify the effective storage space that their data is occupying in the cloud, and consequently to check whether they qualify for benefits such as price reductions, etc. ClearBox is secure against malicious users and a rational storage provider, and ensures that files can only be accessed by their legitimate owners.

46,"Security concerns are often mentioned amongst the reasons why organizations hesitate to adopt Cloud computing. Given that multiple Cloud Service Providers (CSPs) offer similar security services (e.g., ""encryption key management"") albeit with different capabilities and prices, the customers need to comparatively assess the offered security services in order to select the best CSP matching their security requirements. However, the presence of both explicit and implicit dependencies across security related services add further challenges for Cloud customers to (i) specify their security requirements taking service dependencies into consideration and (ii) to determine which CSP can satisfy these requirements. We present a framework to address these challenges. For challenge (i), our framework automatically detects conflicts resulting from inconsistent customer requirements. Moreover, our framework provides an explanation for the detected conflicts allowing customers to resolve these conflicts. To tackle challenge (ii), our framework assesses the security level provided by various CSPs and ranks the CSPs according to the desired customer requirements.

47,"The emergence of cost-effective cloud services offers organizations great opportunity to reduce their cost and increase productivity. This development, however, is hampered by privacy concerns: a significant amount of organizational computing workload at least partially involves sensitive data and therefore cannot be directly outsourced to the public cloud. The scale of these computing tasks also renders existing secure outsourcing techniques less applicable. A natural solution is to split a task, keeping the computation on the private data within an organization's private cloud while moving the rest to the public commercial cloud. However, this hybrid cloud computing is not supported by today's data-intensive computing frameworks, MapReduce in particular, which forces the users to manually split their computing tasks. In this paper, we present a suite of new techniques that make such privacy-aware data-intensive computing possible. Our system, called Sedic, leverages the special features of MapReduce to automatically partition a computing job according to the security levels of the data it works on, and arrange the computation across a hybrid cloud. Specifically, we modified MapReduce's distributed file system to strategically replicate data, moving sanitized data blocks to the public cloud. Over this data placement, map tasks are carefully scheduled to outsource as much workload to the public cloud as possible, given sensitive data always stay on the private cloud. To minimize inter-cloud communication, our approach also automatically analyzes and transforms the reduction structure of a submitted job to aggregate the map outcomes within the public cloud before sending the result back to the private cloud for the final reduction. This also allows the users to interact with our system in the same way they work with MapReduce, and directly run their legacy code in our framework. We implemented Sedic on Hadoop and evaluated it using both real and synthesized computing jobs on a large-scale cloud test-bed. The study shows that our techniques effectively protect sensitive user data, offload a large amount of computation to the public cloud and also fully preserve the scalability of MapReduce.",https://dl.acm.org/ft_gateway.cfm?id=2046767&ftid=1047067&dwn=1&CFID=84020132&CFTOKEN=a6f8f8e912c797a3-8C549BFF-CC18-FBDE-FEB65C7292D379D9,https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2046767&preflayout=flat,27,"1,884",October 2011,Sedic: privacy-aware data intensive computing on hybrid clouds,CCS '11: Proceedings of the 18th ACM conference on Computer and communications security

This paper introduces the future emerging technology, i.e., Vehicular Cloud Networking (VCN) where vehicles and adjacent infrastructure merge with traditional internet clouds to offer different applications ranging from low sized applications to very complex applications. VCN is composed of three types of clouds: Vehicular cloud, Infrastructure cloud and traditional Back-End (IT) cloud. We introduced these clouds via a three tier architecture along with their operations and characteristics. We have proposed use cases of each cloud tier that explain how it is practically created and utilised while taking the vehicular mobility in consideration. Moreover, it is critical to ensure security, privacy and trust of VCN network and its assets. Therefore, to describe the security of VCN, we have provided an in-depth analysis of different threats related to each tier of VCN. The threats related to vehicular cloud and infrastructure cloud are categorized according to their assets, i.e., vehicles, adjacent infrastructure, wireless communication, vehicular messages, and vehicular cloud threats.

55,"Cloud computing has emerged as a popular computing paradigm in recent years. However, today's cloud computing architectures often lack support for computer forensic investigations. Analyzing various logs (e.g., process logs, network logs) plays a vital role in computer forensics. Unfortunately, collecting logs from a cloud is very hard given the black-box nature of clouds and the multi-tenant cloud models, where many users share the same processing and network resources. Researchers have proposed using log API or cloud management console to mitigate the challenges of collecting logs from cloud infrastructure. However, there has been no concrete work, which shows how to provide cloud logs to investigator while preserving users' privacy and integrity of the logs. In this paper, we introduce Secure-Logging-as-a-Service (SecLaaS), which stores virtual machines' logs and provides access to forensic investigators ensuring the confidentiality of the cloud users. Additionally, SeclaaS preserves proofs of past log and thus protects the integrity of the logs from dishonest investigators or cloud providers.

Hence the need to implement the concept of information security as part of the system. Information security primary focus is the balanced protection of the confidentiality, integrity and availability of stored data (CIA). Cloud system is one of the platforms that provides a database as a service (DBaaS), typically it takes care of scalability and high availability of the database. The confidentiality and integrity of stored data is still not guaranteed by some cloud systems because there is no trust between data owners and third-party platforms (Cloud systems). CryptDBaaS is a security model integrating cloud computing with cryptography to provide a security mechanism for data owners, which aims to guarantee the confidentiality of stored data in the cloud from unauthorized access or misuse of data from third party. CryptDBaaS model illustrates how to encrypt your data before storing it using secure and suitable encryption algorithms based on data type and allows to execute queries and performs some mathematical and logical operations over encrypted database. CryptDBaaS is evaluated by conducting a simulation to measure performance and accuracy of queries and search techniques CryptDBaaS provides. Evaluation step shows that CryptDBaaS has a high performance with respect to the encryption and search algorithms. The queries are executed as if they were executed over plain text data, so the obtained accuracy is 100% for all queries and operators except the search one which has 50% or 100% of accuracy based on chosen technique.",https://dl.acm.org/ft_gateway.cfm?id=3231068&ftid=2000020&dwn=1&CFID=84020132&CFTOKEN=a6f8f8e912c797a3-8C549BFF-CC18-FBDE-FEB65C7292D379D9,https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3231068&preflayout=flat,0,58,June 2018,CryptDBaaS: query over encrypted DBaaS without third-party,ICFNDS '18: Proceedings of the 2nd International Conference on Future Networks and Distributed Systems

However this also caused more attack opportunities. A typical example is a cross-VM timing channel. Recent studies show that this kind of covert channel can successfully steal private information (e.g. private key) from the co-resident VM instances. It brought great challenges to the security of the cloud and has absorbed more and more attention in recent years. But to our knowledge, there is still little work on detecting and investigating such covert channel. Therefore, we propose a behavior-based method to automatically detect and investigate the timing channel. First, in order to record the behavior of this covert channel, a page-level memory monitoring method is designed. Second, an automatic identification algorithm is proposed based on some memory activity signatures.

63,"Data loss is perceived as one of the major threats for cloud storage. Consequently, the security community developed several challenge-response protocols that allow a user to remotely verify whether an outsourced file is still intact. However, two important practical problems have not yet been considered. First, clients commonly outsource multiple files of different sizes, raising the question how to formalize such a scheme and in particular ensuring that all files can be simultaneously audited. Second, in case auditing of the files fails, existing schemes do not provide a client with any method to prove if the original files are still recoverable. We address both problems and describe appropriate solutions. The first problem is tackled by providing a new type of ""Proofs of Retrievability"" scheme, enabling a client to check all files simultaneously in a compact way. The second problem is solved by defining a novel procedure called ""Proofs of Recoverability"", enabling a client to obtain an assurance whether a file is recoverable or irreparably damaged.

Existing solutions, such as Attribute-Based Encryption (ABE) and Key Aggregation Cryptosystem (KAC), can be utilized to address the challenge, but only to a certain extent. They are often computationally expensive and thus unlikely to operate at scale. We propose an algorithmic enhancement and two heuristics to improve KAC's key reconstruction cost, while preserving its provable security. The improvement is particularly significant for range and down-sampling queries -- accelerating the reconstruction cost from quadratic to linear running time. Experimental study shows that for queries of size 32k samples, the proposed fast reconstruction techniques speed-up the original KAC by at least 90 times on range and down-sampling queries, and by eight times on general (arbitrary) queries. It also shows that at the expense of splitting the query into 16 sub-queries and correspondingly issuing that number of different aggregated keys, reconstruction time can be reduced by 19 times.

While the community features a number of cloud-based security mechanisms, existing solutions either provide security at the expense of the economy of scale and cost effectiveness of the cloud (i.e., at the expense of resource sharing and deduplication techniques), or they meet the latter objectives at the expense of security (e.g., the customer is required to fully trust the provider). In this paper, we shed light on this problem, and we analyze the challenges in reconciling security and functional requirements in existing multi-tenant clouds. We also explore the solution space to effectively enhance the current security offerings of existing cloud storage services.

76,"Cloud computing is a revolutionary breakthrough in computing technology. It allows businesses to supply their customers with a seemingly endless amount of resources on demand, so long as they are willing to pay for it. From a business perspective, cloud computing is revolutionizing profitability. From a security standpoint, cloud computing presents an alarming amount of risk to customer data. When customers make purchases, they transfer data to a Cloud Service Provider (CSP), but are unable to evaluate which CSP has sufficient security controls to protect their sensitive data. The Cloud Security Alliance (CSA) is an organization whose mission is to suggest best practice security controls and guidelines for CSPs to follow. The CSA provides a questionnaire or risk assessment, known as the Consensus Assessment Initiative Questionnaire (CAIQ) for CSPs to fill out in order to gauge their level of security within their organization. The CSPs access these questionnaires from the CSA's STAR (Security Trust and Assurance Registry) database. This allows for CSUs to base their level of trust in a specific organization on these assessments. However, there is no way for the CSA to validate that the CSP's responses to the questionnaire are accurate. This paper presents a framework that uses a third-party auditor (TPA) to review, audit, and validate the CAIQ responses stored in the STAR repository. Our framework provides a specific group of auditors that can be used to evaluate and validate the security controls of CSPs. Therefore, the primary objective of this research is to formulate the mechanism by which the appropriate auditor(s) can be chosen by the TPA and create a verification system in which CSUs may finally put their trust in.",https://dl.acm.org/ft_gateway.cfm?id=3025154&ftid=1947177&dwn=1&CFID=84020132&CFTOKEN=a6f8f8e912c797a3-8C549BFF-CC18-FBDE-FEB65C7292D379D9,https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3025154&preflayout=flat,0,56,March 2017,Security evaluation of cloud service providers using third party auditors,"ICC '17: Proceedings of the Second International Conference on Internet of things, Data and Cloud Computing"

81,"In response to the revival of virtualized technology by Rosenblum and Garfinkel [2005], NIST defined cloud computing, a new paradigm in service computing infrastructures. In cloud environments, the basic security mechanism is ingrained in virtualization—that is, the execution of instructions at different privilege levels. Despite its obvious benefits, the caveat is that a crashed virtual machine (VM) is much harder to recover than a crashed workstation. When crashed, a VM is nothing but a giant corrupt binary file and quite unrecoverable by standard disk-based forensics. Therefore, VM crashes should be avoided at all costs. Security is one of the major contributors to such VM crashes. This includes compromising the hypervisor, cloud storage, images of VMs used infrequently, and remote cloud client used by the customer as well as threat from malicious insiders. Although using secure infrastructures such as private clouds alleviate several of these security problems, most cloud users end up using cheaper options such as third-party infrastructures (i.e., private clouds), thus a thorough discussion of all known security issues is pertinent. Hence, in this article, we discuss ongoing research in cloud security in order of the attack scenarios exploited most often in the cloud environment. We explore attack scenarios that call for securing the hypervisor, exploiting co-residency of VMs, VM image management, mitigating insider threats, securing storage in clouds, abusing lightweight software-as-a-service clients, and protecting data propagation in clouds. Wearing a practitioner's glasses, we explore the relevance of each attack scenario to a service company like Infosys. At the same time, we draw parallels between cloud security research and implementation of security solutions in the form of enterprise security suites for the cloud.

85,"Countless systems ranging from consumer electronics to military equipment are dependent on integrated circuits (ICs). A surprisingly large number of such systems are already security- critical, e.g., automotive electronics, medical devices, or SCADA systems. If the underlying ICs in such applications are maliciously manipulated through hardware Trojans, the security of the entire system can be compromised. In recent years, hardware Trojans have drawn the attention of the scientific community and government. Initially, the primary attacker model was a malicious foundry that could alter the design, i.e., introduce hardware Trojans which could interfere with the functionality of a chip. Many other attacker models exist too. For instance, a legitimate IC manufacturer, such as a consumer electronics company, might be in cohort with a national intelligence agency and could alter its products in a way that compromises their security. Even though hardware Trojans have been studied for a decade or so in the literature, little is known about how they might look, and what the ""use cases"" for them is. We describe two applications for low-level hardware manipulations. One introduces an ASIC Trojans by sub-transistor changes, and the other is a novel type of fault-injection attacks against FPGAs. As an example for an extremely stealthy manipulations, we show how a dangerous Trojans can be introduced by merely changing the dopant polarity of selected existing transistors of a design. The Trojan manipulates the digital post-processing of Intel's cryptographically secure random number generator used in the Ivy Bridge processors. The adversary is capable of exactly controlling the entropy of the RNG. For example, the attacker can reduce the RNG's entropy to 40 bits of randomness. Due to the AES-based one-way function after the entropy extracting, the Trojan is very difficult to detect. Crucially, this approach does not require to add new circuits to the IC. Since the modified circuit appears legitimate on all wiring layers (including all metal and polysilicon), our family of Trojans is resistant to many detection techniques, including fine-grain optical inspection and checking against ""golden chips"". As a second ""use case"", we show how an adversary can extract cryptographic keys from an unknown FPGA design. The attack, coined bitstream fault injection (BiFI), systematically manipulates the bitstream by changing random LUT contents, configures the target device, and collects the resulting faulty ciphertexts. The ciphertexts are used to recover the key by testing a set of hypotheses, e.g., that the ciphertext is the plaintext XORed with the key. The attack only needs a black-box assumption about the bitstream structure and format. It was verified by considering a set of 3 rd party AES designs on different standard FPGAs. In 15 out of 16 designs, we were able to extract the AES key.",https://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81500650510&coll=DL&dl=ACM&trk=0,https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3248552&preflayout=flat,0,n/a,April 2017,Session details: Cloud Security,ASIA CCS '17: Proceedings of the 2017 ACM on Asia Conference on Computer and Communications Security

94,"The security of clients' applications on the cloud platforms has been of great interest. Security concerns associated with cloud computing are improving in both the domains; security issues faced by cloud providers and security issues faced by clients. However, security concerns still remain in domains like cloud auditing and migrating application components to cloud to make the process more secure and cost-efficient. To an extent, this can be attributed to a lack of detailed information being publicly present about the cloud platforms and their security policies. A resolution in this regard can be found in Cloud Security Alliance's Security, Trust, and Assurance Registry (STAR) which documents the security controls provided by popular cloud computing offerings. In this paper, we perform some descriptive analysis on STAR data in an attempt to comprehend the information publicly presented by different cloud providers. It is to help clients in more effectively searching and analyzing the required security information they need for the decision making process for hosting their applications on cloud. Based on the analysis, we outline some augmentations that can be made to STAR as well as certain specific design improvements for a cloud migration risk assessment framework.",https://dl.acm.org/ft_gateway.cfm?id=3154343&ftid=1939867&dwn=1&CFID=84020132&CFTOKEN=a6f8f8e912c797a3-8C549BFF-CC18-FBDE-FEB65C7292D379D9,https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3154343&preflayout=flat,0,109,January 2018,"Data Analysis of Cloud Security Alliance's Security, Trust & Assurance Registry",ICDCN '18: Proceedings of the 19th International Conference on Distributed Computing and Networking
95,"In this paper, we report the first large-scale, systematic study on the security qualities of emerging push-messaging services, focusing on their app-side service integrations. We identified a set of security properties different push-messaging services (e.g., Google Cloud Messaging) need to have, and automatically verified them in different integrations using a new technique, called Seminal. Seminal is designed to extract semantic information from a service's sample code, and leverage the information to evaluate the security qualities of the service's SDKs and its integrations within different apps. Using this tool, we studied 30 leading services around the world, and scanned 35,173 apps. Our findings are astonishing: over 20% apps in Google Play and 50% apps in mainstream Chinese app markets are riddled with security-critical loopholes, putting a huge amount of sensitive user data at risk. Also, our research brought to light new types of security flaws never known before, which can be exploited to cause serious confusions among popular apps and services (e.g., Facebook, Skype, Yelp, Baidu Push). Taking advantage of such confusions, the adversary can post his content to the victim's apps in the name of trusted parties and intercept her private messages.

96,"Searchable Symmetric Encryption (SSE) when deployed in the cloud allows one to query encrypted data without the risk of data leakage. Despite the widespread interest, existing surveys do not examine in detail how SSE’s underlying structures are designed and how these result in the many properties of a SSE scheme. This is the gap we seek to address, as well as presenting recent state-of-the-art advances on SSE. Specifically, we present a general framework and believe the discussions may lead to insights for potential new designs. We draw a few observations. First, most schemes use index table, where optimal index size and sublinear search can be achieved using an inverted index. Straightforward updating can only be achieved using direct index, but search time would be linear. A recent trend is the combinations of index table, and tree, deployed for efficient updating and storage. Secondly, mechanisms from related fields such as Oblivious RAM (ORAM) have been integrated to reduce leakages. However, using these mechanisms to minimise leakages in schemes with richer functionalities (e.g., ranked, range) is relatively unexplored. Thirdly, a new approach (e.g., multiple servers) is required to mitigate new and emerging attacks on leakage. Lastly, we observe that a proposed index may not be practically efficient when implemented, where I/O access must be taken into consideration.",https://dl.acm.org/ft_gateway.cfm?id=3064005&ftid=1876779&dwn=1&CFID=84020132&CFTOKEN=a6f8f8e912c797a3-8C549BFF-CC18-FBDE-FEB65C7292D379D9,https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3064005&preflayout=flat,4,"1,114",May 2017,Searchable Symmetric Encryption: Designs and Challenges,"ACM Computing Surveys (CSUR): Volume 50 Issue 3, October 2017"

As time goes on, the defender can incrementally learn from the collected/observed attack samples (e.g., malware payloads), and therefore being able to generate attack signatures. The generated signatures then are used for filtering next attack traffic and thus containing the attacker's progress in its malware propagation mission.

From the viewpoint of organizational risk management, it is necessary to control the risks of the cloud computing environment used as part of an organization's information system in order to minimize any negative influence on the organization's mission or business processes. In a previous article, the authors divided cloud security metrics into two security levels. One level shows how the security metrics influence the mission or business processes in 27 dimensions. The other level shows the security status at the time and the influence range when an incident occurs. This article focuses the latter variable security level and describes the results of developing a cloud security visualization system that was designed based on collection, analysis, and visualization architecture to calculate the level. From the viewpoint of security risk management, the system is considerered to be effective for cloud service providers because it reduces the time needed to investigate the cause of incidents and to recover from them, it helps in triage assessment when many incidents happen simultaneously, and it can detect warnings of an incident and forestall such incidents before they occur.",https://dl.acm.org/ft_gateway.cfm?id=2372232&ftid=1291797&dwn=1&CFID=84020132&CFTOKEN=a6f8f8e912c797a3-8C549BFF-CC18-FBDE-FEB65C7292D379D9,https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2372232&preflayout=flat,1,600,September 2012,Development of qualification of security status suitable for cloud computing system,MetriSec '12: Proceedings of the 4th international workshop on Security measurements and metrics

Currently, the major defense against Android malware is commercial mobile security products which mainly use signature-based method for detection.

In this paper, resting on the analysis of Application Programming Interface (API) calls extracted from the smali files, we further categorize the API calls which belong to the some method in the smali code into a block. Based on the generated API call blocks, we then explore deep neural networks (i.e., Deep Belief Network (DBN) and Stacked AutoEncoders (SAEs)) for newly unknown Android malware detection. Using a real sample collection from Comodo Cloud Security Center, a comprehensive experimental study is performed to compare various malware detection approaches. The experimental results demonstrate that (1) our proposed feature extraction method (i.e., using API call blocks) outperforms using API calls directly in Android malware detection; (2) DBN works better than SAEs in this application; and (3) the detection performance of deep neural networks is better than shallow learning architectures.",https://dl.acm.org/ft_gateway.cfm?id=3116211&ftid=1921987&dwn=1&CFID=84020132&CFTOKEN=a6f8f8e912c797a3-8C549BFF-CC18-FBDE-FEB65C7292D379D9,https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3116211&preflayout=flat,0,221,July 2017,Deep Neural Networks for Automatic Android Malware Detection,ASONAM '17: Proceedings of the 2017 IEEE/ACM International Conference on Advances in Social Networks Analysis and Mining 2017
144,"With explosive growth of Android malware and due to the severity of its damages to smart phone users, the detection of Android malware has become increasingly important in cybersecurity. The increasing sophistication of Android malware calls for new defensive techniques that are capable against novel threats and harder to evade. In this paper, to detect Android malware, instead of using Application Programming Interface (API) calls only, we further analyze the different relationships between them and create higher-level semantics which require more effort for attackers to evade the detection. We represent the Android applications (apps), related APIs, and their rich relationships as a structured heterogeneous information network (HIN). Then we use a meta-path based approach to characterize the semantic relatedness of apps and APIs. We use each meta-path to formulate a similarity measure over Android apps, and aggregate different similarities using multi-kernel learning. Then each meta-path is automatically weighted by the learning algorithm to make predictions. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to use structured HIN for Android malware detection. Comprehensive experiments on real sample collections from Comodo Cloud Security Center are conducted to compare various malware detection approaches.

For some applications managing sensitive data, cloud security solutions and data-privacy management are the main concerns for organizations that are considering a move to the cloud. The advantages of cloud computing include reduced costs, easy maintenance and re-provisioning of resources, thereby also possibly increasing profits. But the adoption of Cloud Computing solutions applies only if different security concerns are ensured. This article presents a solution for data storage and data management in Internet Storage Clouds, preserving privacy conditions under the control of Cloud users. The proposed solution supports operations over stored encrypted data, including reading, writing and searching based on relevance ranking and multiple keywords. The approach is based on a middleware architecture supported by homomorphic encryption techniques combined with dynamic indexing mechanisms. The solution preserves data-privacy without need to either decipher data during operations in the Cloud or transfer the data during searches.

150,"Due to its severe damages and threats to the security of the Internet and computing devices, malware detection has caught the attention of both anti-malware industry and researchers for decades. To combat the evolving malware attacks, in this paper, we first study how to utilize both content- and relation-based features to characterize sly malware; to model different types of entities (i.e., file, archive, machine, API, DLL ) and the rich semantic relationships among them (i.e., file-archive, file-machine, file-file, API-DLL, file-API relations), we then construct a structural heterogeneous information network (HIN) and present meta-graph based approach to depict the relatedness over files. To measure the relatedness over files on the constructed HIN, since malware detection is a cost-sensitive task, it calls for efficient methods to learn latent representations for HIN. To address this challenge, based on the built meta-graph schemes, we propose a new HIN embedding model metagraph2vec on the first attempt to learn the low-dimensional representations for the nodes in HIN, where both the HIN structures and semantics are maximally preserved for malware detection.

Therefore, security assurance must be evaluated before offloading tasks to a cloud provider, a process which is currently manual, complex and inadequate for dynamic scenarios. However, though there are many tools for evaluating cloud providers according to quality of service criteria, automated categorization and selection based on risk metrics is still challenging.

In Inter-Cloud systems, security is one of the most important challenges, because of the need for dynamic sharing, federation, and collaboration across multiple clouds. Security in this type of systems relies heavily on the establishment of trust among the involved components. It can be harder to achieve security if a comprehensive and detailed architecture is not developed; the lack of a common architecture slows down the process of Inter-Cloud adoption and has a negative impact on the process of making these systems more secure.

The one important factor to decrease the likelihood of this co-location attack is the VMs placement strategy. However, a co-location resistant strategy will compromise the resources optimization of the cloud providers. The tradeoff between security and resources optimization introduces one of the most crucial challenges in the cloud security. In this work we propose a placement strategy allowing the decrease of co-location rate by compromising the VM startup time instead of the optimization of resources. We give a mathematical analysis to quantify the co-location resistance. The proposed strategy is evaluated against the abusing placement locality, where the attack and target VMs are launched simultaneously or within a short time window. Referring to EC2 placement strategy, the best co-location resistant strategy out of the existing public cloud providers strategies, our strategy decreases enormously the co-location attacks with a slight VM startup delay (relatively to the actual VM startup delay in the public cloud providers).",https://dl.acm.org/ft_gateway.cfm?id=2996435&ftid=1808208&dwn=1&CFID=84020132&CFTOKEN=a6f8f8e912c797a3-8C549BFF-CC18-FBDE-FEB65C7292D379D9,https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2996435&preflayout=flat,0,110,October 2016,Co-location Resistant Strategy with Full Resources Optimization,CCSW '16: Proceedings of the 2016 ACM on Cloud Computing Security Workshop

To protect legitimate users from the evolving Android malware attacks, machine learning-based systems have been successfully deployed and offer unparalleled flexibility in automatic Android malware detection. In these systems, based on different feature representations, various kinds of classifiers are constructed to detect Android malware. Unfortunately, as classifiers become more widely deployed, the incentive for defeating them increases. In this paper, we explore the security of machine learning in Android malware detection on the basis of a learning-based classifier with the input of a set of features extracted from the Android applications (apps). We consider different importances of the features associated with their contributions to the classification problem as well as their manipulation costs, and present a novel feature selection method (named SecCLS) to make the classifier harder to be evaded. To improve the system security while not compromising the detection accuracy, we further propose an ensemble learning approach (named SecENS) by aggregating the individual classifiers that are constructed using our proposed feature selection method SecCLS. Accordingly, we develop a system called SecureDroid which integrates our proposed methods (i.e., SecCLS and SecENS) to enhance security of machine learning-based Android malware detection.

166,"Cloud computing has emerged as a fast-growing technology in the past few years. It provides a great flexibility for storing, sharing and delivering data over the Internet without investing on new technology or resources. In spite of the development and wide array of cloud usage, security perspective of cloud computing still remains its infancy. Security challenges faced by cloud environment becomes more complicated when we include various stakeholders' perspectives. In a cloud environment, security perspectives and requirements are usually designed by software engineers or security experts. Sometimes clients' requirements are either ignored or given a very high importance. In order to implement cloud security by providing equal importance to client organizations, software engineers and security experts, we propose a new methodology in this paper. We use Microsoft's STRIDE-DREAD model to assess threats existing in the cloud environment and also to measure its consequences. Our aim is to rank the threats based on the nature of its severity, and also giving a significant importance for clients' requirements on security perspective. Our methodology would act as a guiding tool for security experts and software engineers to proceed with securing process especially for a private or a hybrid cloud. Once threats are ranked, we provide a link to a well-known security pattern classification. Although we have some security pattern classification schemes in the literature, we need a methodology to select a particular category of patterns. In this paper, we provide a novel methodology to select a set of security patterns for securing a cloud software. This methodology could aid a security expert or a software professional to assess the current vulnerability condition and prioritize by also including client's security requirements in a cloud environment.",https://dl.acm.org/ft_gateway.cfm?id=2857552&ftid=1693304&dwn=1&CFID=84020132&CFTOKEN=a6f8f8e912c797a3-8C549BFF-CC18-FBDE-FEB65C7292D379D9,https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2857552&preflayout=flat,0,199,January 2016,Threat Assessment in the Cloud Environment: A Quantitative Approach for Security Pattern Selection,IMCOM '16: Proceedings of the 10th International Conference on Ubiquitous Information Management and Communication

169,"Distributed ""edge"" clouds provide the performance and security attributes to fill the cloud gap. The talk will cover the challenges and opportunities in bringing cloud to the comms infrastructure. ""Edge Cloud"" architectures are emerging as an area of increased interest and development. Unlike the binary choices of private cloud and hyperscale cloud of today, these distributed cloud and data center architectures enable new use cases that have impact now and set the stage for forthcoming technologies such as 5G, AR/VR and AI. Edge deployments bring compute and storage closer to the customer, allowing: (1) execution of low latency workloads (i.e: storage gateway, IoT or AR) while also increasing the throughput thanks to the compute distribution; (2) enhanced TCO thanks to the ability to reduce long haul traffic to more remote data centers (i.e: CDN); and (3) the ability to retain data in local or regional basis-an area of increasing regulatory importance.",https://dl.acm.org/ft_gateway.cfm?id=3306643&ftid=2034586&dwn=1&CFID=84020132&CFTOKEN=a6f8f8e912c797a3-8C549BFF-CC18-FBDE-FEB65C7292D379D9,https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3306643&preflayout=flat,0,48,October 2018,Challenges and opportunities for edge cloud architectures,NOCS '18: Proceedings of the Twelfth IEEE/ACM International Symposium on Networks-on-Chip

171,"Application and platform security has always been critical for the success of any business. Traditionally, applications were deployed directly on physical servers. As a result, there are myriad traditional security solutions that were developed around this model to run as local agents on the systems they monitor and protect. These solutions are then refined and standardized with decades of experience. With the emergence of virtualization, cloud and particularly containerization, use of these solutions is becoming challenging with consolidation and scale. As we begin to deploy hundreds of cloud instances on a single node, traditional solutions, designed for local execution do not scale out. At the same time, the clean separation of a virtual machine (VM) or a container from the platform itself, and maturing introspection and inspection APIs provide a simple, practical way to decouple monitored from the monitors [3]. Furthermore, as the scope of cloud security expands from simple monitoring and auditing to more complex learning based analytics, analytics components are further offloaded to separate data services, where they can burn extensive cycles, and in some cases use specialized hardware for security analytics, out of the critical path of the monitored applications [5]. As a result, traditional agent-based tightly-coupled model is being replaced by a more dis-aggregated {system, observation, analytics, actions} architecture.",https://dl.acm.org/ft_gateway.cfm?id=3275470&ftid=2006408&dwn=1&CFID=84020132&CFTOKEN=a6f8f8e912c797a3-8C549BFF-CC18-FBDE-FEB65C7292D379D9,https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3275470&preflayout=flat,0,93,October 2018,Drishti: Disaggregated and Interoperable Security Analytics Framework for Cloud,SoCC '18: Proceedings of the ACM Symposium on Cloud Computing
