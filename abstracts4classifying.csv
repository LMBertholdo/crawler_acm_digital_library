0|2662382|Today botnets are responsible for most of the DDoS attacks on the Internet. Understanding the characteristics of such DDoS attacks is critical to develop effective DDoS mitigation schemes. In this poster, we present some preliminary findings, mainly concerning the distribution of the attackers, of today's DDoS attacks. Our investigation is based on 50,704 different Internet DDoS attacks collected within a seven-month period for activities across the globe. These attacks were launched by 674 botnet generations from 23 different bonet families with a total of 9026 victim IPs belonging to 1074 organizations that are collectively located in 186 countries. We find that different from the traditional widely distributed intuition, most of these DDoS attacks are not widely distributed as the attackers are mostly from the same region, i.e., highly regionalized. We also find that different botnet families have strong target preferences in the same area as well. These findings refresh our understanding on the modern DDoS attacks.|||||||
1|3103164|The traditional physical power grid is evolving into a cyber-physical Smart Grid (SG) that links the cyber communication and computational elements with the physical control functions to dynamically integrate varied and geographically distributed energy producers/consumers. In the SG, the cyber elements of Wide Area Measurement Systems (WAMS) are deployed to provide the critical monitoring of the state of power transmission and distribution to accomplish real-time control of the grid. Unfortunately, the increasing adoption of such computing/communication cyber-technologies essential to providing the SG operations also opens the risk of the SG being vulnerable to cyberattacks. In particular, attacks such as Denial-of-Service (DoS) and Distributed DoS (DDoS) are of primary concern for WAMS where such attacks can compromise its safety-critical accuracy and responsiveness characteristics.|||||||

Many research efforts have been made with the purpose of proving the feasibility and the scalability of this proposal. Our main contribution is to provide an analysis of the Pending Interest Table memory requirements in real deployment scenarios, especially considering the impact of distributed denial of service attacks. In fact, the state that the protocol maintains for each resource request makes the routers more prone to resources exhaustion issues than in traditional stateless solutions. Our results are derived by using a full custom simulator and considering the different node architectures that have been proposed as valid reference models. The main outcomes point out differentiated weaknesses in each architecture we investigated and underline the need for improvements in terms of security and scalability.|||||||
4|2079334|Recent distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks have demonstrated horrible destructive power by paralyzing web servers within short time. As the volume of Internet traffic rapidly grows up, the current DDoS detection technologies have met a new challenge that should efficiently deal with a huge amount of traffic within the affordable response time. In this work, we propose a novel DDoS detection method based on Hadoop that implements a HTTP GET flooding detection algorithm in MapReduce on the distributed computing platform.|||||||
5|3274717|Volumetric distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks can bring any network to a halt. Because of their distributed nature and high volume, the victim often cannot handle these attacks alone and needs help from upstream ISPs. Today's Internet has no automated mechanism for victims to ask ISPs for help in attack handling and ISPs themselves do not offer such services. We propose SENSS, a security service for collaborative mitigation of volumetric DDoS attacks. SENSS enables the victim of an attack to request attack monitoring and filtering on demand, and to pay for the services rendered. Requests can be sent both to the immediate and to remote ISPs, in an automated and secure manner, and can be authenticated by these ISPs, without having prior trust with the victim. Simple and generic SENSS APIs enable victims to build custom detection and mitigation approaches against a variety of DDoS attacks. SENSS is deployable with today's infrastructure, and it has strong economic incentives both for ISPs and for the attack victims. It is also very effective in sparse deployment, offering full protection to direct customers of early adopters, and considerable protection to remote victims when deployed strategically. Deployment on the largest 1% of ISPs protects not just direct customers of these ISPs, but everyone on the Internet, from 90% of volumetric DDoS attacks.|||||||
6|3342037|Software-defined networks have introduced innovative changes in communication networks by separating and centralizing control plane from the data forwarding plane, making the network more manageable and adaptable. SDN is widely getting adapted in the IoT environment mainly for the reason of security. Although SDN enhances network security with the centralized control of network behavior, it has its own challenges in terms of security. SDN controller is prone to DoS/DDoS attacks where attackers may flood controller with a large number of new flows beyond the controller's capacity, causing network failure for legitimate users. These attacks could be worse in the IoT context due to its open nature. A verity of techniques has been proposed for SDN controller attack mitigation, each could be categorized based on entropy, time, trust management and scheduling schemes used differently, but trust-based request prioritization solutions are simplest among these due to their resource requirements and less response time. Our proposed technique for mitigation of DDoS attacks is even based on trust management but specifically crafted for IoT environment that ensures maximal and optimal utilization of available resources, with the aim to reduce the load on the controller while making contest against attack more effective.|||||||

8|2813633|"The increase of Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attacks in volume, frequency, and complexity, combined with the constant required alertness for mitigating web application threats, has caused many website owners to turn to Cloud-based Security Providers (CBSPs) to protect their infrastructure. These solutions typically involve the rerouting of traffic from the original website through the CBSP's network, where malicious traffic can be detected and absorbed before it ever reaches the servers of the protected website. The most popular Cloud-based Security Providers do not require the purchase of dedicated traffic-rerouting hardware, but rely solely on changing the DNS settings of a domain name to reroute a website's traffic through their security infrastructure. Consequently, this rerouting mechanism can be completely circumvented by directly attacking the website's hosting IP address. Therefore, it is crucial for the security and availability of these websites that their real IP address remains hidden from potential attackers. In this paper, we discuss existing, as well as novel ""origin-exposing"" attack vectors which attackers can leverage to discover the IP address of the server where a website protected by a CBSP is hosted. To assess the impact of the discussed origin-exposing vectors on the security of CBSP-protected websites, we consolidate all vectors into CloudPiercer, an automated origin-exposing tool, which we then use to conduct the first large-scale analysis of the effectiveness of the origin-exposing vectors. Our results show that the problem is severe: 71.5% of the 17,877 CBSP-protected websites that we tested, expose their real IP address through at least one of the evaluated vectors. The results of our study categorically demonstrate that a comprehensive adoption of CBSPs is harder than just changing DNS records. Our findings can steer CBSPs and site administrators towards effective countermeasures, such as proactively scanning for origin exposure and using appropriate network configurations that can greatly reduce the threat."|||||||
9|3287940|TCP-targeted low-rate distributed denial-of-service (LDDoS) attacks have created an opportunity for attackers to reduce their total attaking rate (and hence, the detection probability of the attacks) while inflicting the same damage to TCP flows as traditional flooding-based DDoS attacks. CPR-based approach has been proposed by Zhang et al. to detect and filter this kind of DDoS attacks, but its performance in terms of TCP throughput under attack is shown to be limited by the way it calculates CPR for each flow. In this paper, we will propose some modifications to the CPR-based approach in order to increase its performance. Simulation results show that the modifications can increase performance significantly.|||||||
10|3022260|DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service) attack is one of the most used DoS (Denial of Service) attack. It is a distributed attack in which an attacker uses a multitude of compromised computers to attack a single target. Those compromised computers that actually execute the attack are called botnet. To hide their identity, the attacker usually uses a third-party server to control and send attack command to bots, this kind of server is called C&C (command & control) server. The detection of C&C sessions is a strong proof of botnet detection and early detection of DDoS attacks as C&C connections occur before a DDoS attack. Network traffic analysis is an effective method to detect C&C sessions as it is hard to avoid encrypting the payload or change command code. We consider a new feature vector with 55 features, and use a random forest algorithm to build the classifier. Random forest is an ensemble of classifiers that can deal with high-dimension problems. In fact, it can also calculate the importance of features that will help us find the key features responsible for the detection of C&C sessions. Experimental results show that our approach has better performance on C&C session detection.|||||||
11|1146894|When a P2P system has millions of concurrently active peers, there is the risk that it could serve as a DDoS engine for attacks against a targeted host. In this paper we describe two approaches to creating a DDoS engine out of a P2P system: the first involves poisoning the distributed index in the peers; the second involves poisoning the routing tables in the peers. For both approaches, the targeted host does not have to be a participant in the P2P system, and could be a web server, a mail server, or a user's desktop. We then examine these two poisoning attacks in Overnet, a popular DHT-based P2P file-sharing system. By using limited poisoning attacks of short duration on Overnet's indexing and routing tables, we create DDoS attacks against a targeted host. We find that with modest effort, both DDoS attacks can direct significant traffic from diverse peers to the target.|||||||

In September of 2016, Mirai software was used to infect more than 100,000 devices and unleash one of the largest distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks up to that time. After this incident, many people identified multiple large attacks coming from Internet of Things (IoT) devices, like CCTV cameras, and described these attacks as a new trend. A technique to detect whether a signal source is counterfeited in the initial stage of a DDoS attack is important. This paper proposes a method for the quick detection of a spoofed Internet protocol (IP) during a DDoS attack based on a DDoS shelter that is established to defend against DDoS attacks. In order to achieve this goal, we evaluate the number of time-to-live hops in normal traffic as a reference for the bandwidth of each network that is accessible to the DDoS shelter. In this study, we conduct an experiment using cases of actual DDoS attacks. As a result of this experiment, we prove that our proposed method quickly detects a spoofed IP.|||||||

14|2677924|"Now a day's web services become key aspect of life. Unfortunately there are several threats to these services. These threats are phishing, e-mail borne viruses, Trojan horse programs, Denial of Service etc. Among of them Distributed Denial of Service attack is a strong and more energetic attack on the Internet. Launching of DDoS attack is an explicit attempt to exhaust the resources of server to prevent legitimate users to access services. The common flooding DDoS attacks can be detected and mitigated by some mechanisms easily cause of the characteristics as flow rate, size of attack packets, but still it is difficult to detect and identifies the Low-Rate DoS attack because the attacker periodically send short burst packets which behave as legitimate traffic to the server. The attack is only detected when the server goes down. So an efficient detection system is required which effectively Characterize the legitimate and attack traffic to detect the attack and stop it to mitigate the effect of these sort of threats. In this article we proposed a complete framework for ""Characterization, Detection and Mitigation of Low-Rate DoS Attacks"" which effectively characterize the flows as attack or legitimate, detects the low-rate DoS attack on the basis of characteristics of low rate and mitigate the effect of this by stopping the attack flow near the source. The effectiveness of this approach have validated by simulation in ns-2, with Shell scripting, on a Linux platform."|||||||
15|2872552|The idea of Internet of Things (IoT) is implanting networked heterogeneous detectors into our daily life. It opens extra channels for information submission and remote control to our physical world. A significant feature of an IoT network is that it collects data from network edges. Moreover, human involvement for network and devices maintenance is greatly reduced, which suggests an IoT network need to be highly self-managed and self-secured. For the reason that the use of IoT is growing in many important fields, the security issues of IoT need to be properly addressed. Among all, Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) is one of the most notorious attacking behaviors over network which interrupt and block genuine user requests by flooding the host server with huge number of requests using a group of zombie computers via geographically distributed internet connections. DDoS disrupts service by creating network congestion and disabling normal functions of network components, which is even more disruptive for IoT. In this paper, a lightweight defensive algorithm for DDoS attack over IoT network environment is proposed and tested against several scenarios to dissect the interactive communication among different types of network nodes.|||||||

17|1514072|Distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack is a continuous critical threat to the Internet. Derived from the low layers, new application-layer-based DDoS attacks utilizing legitimate HTTP requests to overwhelm victim resources are more undetectable. The case may be more serious when such attacks mimic or occur during the flash crowd event of a popular Website. Focusing on the detection for such new DDoS attacks, a scheme based on document popularity is introduced. An Access Matrix is defined to capture the spatial-temporal patterns of a normal flash crowd. Principal component analysis and independent component analysis are applied to abstract the multidimensional Access Matrix. A novel anomaly detector based on hidden semi-Markov model is proposed to describe the dynamics of Access Matrix and to detect the attacks. The entropy of document popularity fitting to the model is used to detect the potential application-layer DDoS attacks. Numerical results based on real Web traffic data are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.|||||||

19|3278534|The Internet's Domain Name System (DNS) is a frequent target of Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attacks, but such attacks have had very different outcomes---some attacks have disabled major public websites, while the external effects of other attacks have been minimal. While on one hand the DNS protocol is relatively simple, the system has many moving parts, with multiple levels of caching and retries and replicated servers. This paper uses controlled experiments to examine how these mechanisms affect DNS resilience and latency, exploring both the client side's DNS user experience, and server-side traffic. We find that, for about 30% of clients, caching is not effective. However, when caches are full they allow about half of clients to ride out server outages that last less than cache lifetimes, caching and retries together allow up to half of the clients to tolerate DDoS attacks longer than cache lifetimes, with 90% query loss, and almost all clients to tolerate attacks resulting in 50% packet loss. While clients may get service during an attack, tail-latency increases for clients. For servers, retries during DDoS attacks increase normal traffic up to 8x. Our findings about caching and retries help explain why users see service outages from some real-world DDoS events, but minimal visible effects from others.|||||||

As a remedy, we propose usage-based pricing and Capacity Provision Networks, which enable victims to disseminate enough incentive along attack paths to stimulate cooperation against DDoS attacks.|||||||

This leads to the necessity of a good DDoS prevention and detection techniques. The paper aims to provide a better solution to these problems using features analysis.

MTI (mean time intervals), POIP (probability of occurrence of IP), TTL (time to live), ACK value, SYN value, time stamp field, differentiated service field and sequence number are analyzed. The incoming packets are classified into normal and attack packets by deploying Naïve Bayes classifier algorithm using the attack and normal profile from previously available datasets. Information gain algorithm is used to decrease the computation time, memory usage and increase efficiency of detection by reducing the number of parameters. The performance increases with more consistency after the application of information gain. The efficiencies of detection before and after the application of information gain are 98% and 99.5% respectively. The computation time is also reduced by 46.6%.

27|2897866|"This study stems from the premise that we need to break away from the ""reactive"" cycle of developing defenses against new DDoS attacks (e.g., amplification) by proactively investigating the potential for new types of DDoS attacks. Our specific focus is on pulsating attacks, a particularly debilitating type that has been hypothesized in the literature. In a pulsating attack, bots coordinate to generate intermittent pulses at target links to significantly reduce the throughput of TCP connections traversing the target. With pulsating attacks, attackers can cause significantly greater damage to legitimate users than traditional link flooding attacks. To date, however, pulsating attacks have been either deemed ineffective or easily defendable for two reasons: (1) they require a central coordinator and can thus be tracked; and (2) they require tight synchronization of pulses, which is difficult even in normal non-congestion scenarios. This paper argues that, in fact, the perceived drawbacks of pulsating attacks are in fact not fundamental. We develop a practical pulsating attack called CICADAS using two key ideas: using both (1) congestion as an implicit signal for decentralized implementation, and (2) a Kalman-filter-based approach to achieve tight synchronization. We validate CICADAS using simulations and wide-area experiments. We also discuss possible countermeasures against this attack."|||||||
28|1241836|IP spoofing has often been exploited by Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks to: 1) conceal flooding sources and dilute localities in flooding traffic, and 2) coax legitimate hosts into becoming reflectors, redirecting and amplifying flooding traffic. Thus, the ability to filter spoofed IP packets near victim servers is essential to their own protection and prevention of becoming involuntary DoS reflectors. Although an attacker can forge any field in the IP header, he cannot falsify the number of hops an IP packet takes to reach its destination. More importantly, since the hop-count values are diverse, an attacker cannot randomly spoof IP addresses while maintaining consistent hop-counts. On the other hand, an Internet server can easily infer the hop-count information from the Time-to-Live (TTL) field of the IP header. Using a mapping between IP addresses and their hop-counts, the server can distinguish spoofed IP packets from legitimate ones. Based on this observation, we present a novel filtering technique, called Hop-Count Filtering (HCF)--which builds an accurate IP-to-hop-count (IP2HC) mapping table--to detect and discard spoofed IP packets. HCF is easy to deploy, as it does not require any support from the underlying network. Through analysis using network measurement data, we show that HCF can identify close to 90% of spoofed IP packets, and then discard them with little collateral damage. We implement and evaluate HCF in the Linux kernel, demonstrating its effectiveness with experimental measurements.|||||||

32|3005773|This paper presents SplitStack, an architecture targeted at mitigating asymmetric DDoS attacks. These attacks are particularly challenging, since attackers can use a limited amount of resources to trigger exhaustion of a particular type of system resource on the server side. SplitStack resolves this by splitting the monolithic stack into many separable components called minimum splittable units (MSUs). If part of the application stack is experiencing a DDoS attack, SplitStack massively replicates just the affected MSUs, potentially across many machines. This allows scaling of the impacted resource separately from the rest of the application stack, so that resources can be precisely added where needed to combat the attack. We validate SplitStack via a preliminary case study, and show that it outperforms naive replication in defending against asymmetric attacks.|||||||

Understanding the latest DDoS attacks can provide new insights for effective defense.

Despite considerable effort made by both research and industry, our recent interviews with over 100 potential DDoS victims in over 10 industry segments indicate that today’s DDoS prevention is far from perfect. On one hand, few academical proposals have ever been deployed in the Internet; on the other hand, solutions offered by existing DDoS prevention vendors are not silver bullet to defend against the entire attack spectrum. Guided by such large-scale study of today’s DDoS defense, in this paper, we present MiddlePolice, the first readily deployable and proactive DDoS prevention mechanism. We carefully architect MiddlePolice such that it requires no changes from both the Internet core and the network stack of clients, yielding instant deployability in the current Internet architecture. Further, relying on our novel capability feedback mechanism, MiddlePolice is able to enforce destination-driven traffic control so that it guarantees to deliver victim-desired traffic regardless of the attacker strategies. We implement a prototype of MiddlePolice and demonstrate its feasibility via extensive evaluations in the Internet, hardware testbed, and large-scale simulations.|||||||
41|3268968|Using Software-defined Networks in wide area (SDN-WAN) has been strongly emerging in the past years. Due to scalability and economical reasons, SDN-WAN mostly uses an in-band control mechanism, which implies that control and data sharing the same critical physical links. However, the in-band control and centralized control architecture can be exploited by attackers to launch distributed denial of service (DDoS) on SDN control plane by flooding the shared links and/or the Open flow agents. Therefore, constructing a resilient software designed network requires dynamic isolation and distribution of the control flow to minimize damage and significantly increase attack cost. Existing solutions fall short to address this challenge because they require expensive extra dedicated resources or changes in OpenFlow protocol. In this paper, we propose a moving target technique called REsilient COntrol Network architecture (ReCON) that uses the same SDN network resources to defend SDN control plane dynamically against the DDoS attacks. ReCON essentially, (1) minimizes the sharing of critical resources among data and control traffic, and (2) elastically increases the limited capacity of the software control agents on-demand by dynamically using the under-utilized resources from within the same SDN network. To implement a practical solution, we formalize ReCON as a constraints satisfaction problem using Satisfiability Modulo Theory (SMT) to guarantee a correct-by-construction control plan placement that can handle dynamic network conditions.|||||||

43|2818684|Distributed Denial of Services (DDoS) Attacks are often the main source of cloud service disruptions. The considerable increase in DDoS attacks strength has drawn attention in detection and mitigation of DDoS attack. Due to use of more powerful botnets, DDoS attacks are harder to detect at the firewall, hence an efficient technique is required to mitigate DDoS attacks in cloud environment. In this paper, we present mitigation technique in cloud environment in swarm network with relay mechanism using Simulated Raindrop Algorithm (SRD), making it possible to model the defense strategy as mathematical optimization task. This algorithm is used with throughput maximization as fitness function. In the testbed setup, we have evaluated the performance of SRD with Intelligent Waterdrop Algorithm (IWD) through simulation and observed that SRD needs about 40%--45% less number of iterations for convergence. The results shows that proposed method can mitigate DDoS attack with high accuracy and achieves more robustness.|||||||

46|2693632|Application layer (L7) Distributed Denial of Service attacks are becoming more common and an emerging threat to legitimate sites. The goal of these attacks is to prevent legitimate users from accessing a website. Due to the nature of the attacks, the low rate, and the sophisticated imitation of user behavior from automated bots, it is difficult to diagnose these on time. There is an evolving 'industry' of blackmailing and using these attacks for illegal profit [1]. Even though L7 DDoS attacks are a serious threat, studying and experimenting with them is challenging. Organizations do not share server logs because of privacy concerns. Furthermore, implementing these attacks requires instrumentation and real testbeds in order to produce realistic attacks for analysis. Therefore, it is difficult to evaluate mitigation and detection techniques. Our contribution is twofold. First, we have developed a set of testbeds on the GENI (Global Environment for Network Infrastructure) cloud infrastructure [2] to facilitate research and development of detection and mitigation techniques of L7 DDoS attacks. Second, we have used a library of attacks to perform post forensic analysis and classify L7 DDoS attacks based on their individual characteristics. Our work automates and simplifies log generation of L7 DDoS attacks for research and experimentation, as well as provides criteria to detect abnormal requests using a library of attacks.|||||||

These benefits are fueled by innovations in orchestration of cloud platforms that make them totally programmable as Software Defined everything Infrastructures (SDxI). At the same time, sophisticated targeted attacks such as Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) are growing on an unprecedented scale threatening the availability of online businesses. In this paper, we present a novel defense system called Dolus to mitigate the impact of DDoS attacks launched against high-value services hosted in SDxI-based cloud platforms. Our Dolus system is able to initiate a 'pretense' in a scalable and collaborative manner to deter the attacker based on threat intelligence obtained from attack feature analysis in a two-stage ensemble learning scheme. Using foundations from pretense theory in child play, Dolus takes advantage of elastic capacity provisioning via 'quarantine virtual machines' and SDxI policy co-ordination across multiple network domains to deceive the attacker by creating a false sense of success. From the time gained through pretense initiation, Dolus enables cloud service providers to decide on a variety of policies to mitigate the attack impact, without disrupting the cloud services experience for legitimate users. We evaluate the efficacy of Dolus using a GENI Cloud testbed and demonstrate its real-time capabilities to: (a) detect DDoS attacks and redirect attack traffic to quarantine resources to engage the attacker under pretense, and (b) coordinate SDxI policies to possibly block DDoS attacks closer to the attack source(s).|||||||

We designed and assessed the potential of the new overlay-based security architecture that addresses the recent evolutions in DDoS attacks. The new security architecture, called ""Dynamic Binary User-Splits (DBUS)"", is designed to protect cloud servers (a) when their legitimate users convert to DoS/DDoS attackers or (b) when DDoS attacks are launched from the legitimate users' host computers that are hijacked by DDoS coordinators. DBUS copes with the situations by sieving attacking traffic from the hijacked legitimate users' host computers using dynamic binary user splits over the migrating entry points to an overlay network. Our discrete event driven simulation suggested that DBUS will efficiently sieve DDoS attacking hosts in many different situations, when a small number of attacking hosts hide behind a large legitimate user group, or when a stampede of DDoS attacking hosts occupy the majority of incoming traffic, without requiring a large number of migrating entry points. We also found that how quickly each migrating entry point can detect excess traffic is a key to keep convergence delay short."|||||||

These attacks are particularly challenging since attackers using limited resources can exhaust the resources of even well-provisioned servers.

If part of the application stack is experiencing a DDoS attack, DeDoS can massively replicate only the affected MSUs, potentially across many machines. This allows scaling of the impacted resource separately from the rest of the application stack so that resources can be precisely added where needed to combat the attack. Our demonstration will show that DeDoS incurs reasonable overheads in normal operations and that it significantly outperforms naïve replication when defending against a range of asymmetric attacks.|||||||

In this paper we introduce IP Fast Hopping, effective network layer software solution against DDoS attacks. Our technology hides real IP address of a server behind a large pool of IP addresses belongs to a number of routers in different networks. Our method provides a network layer approach to prevent unauthorized access to a server that sometimes is important for the Internet of Things. Our approach implies real-time changing of server's IP address according to a schedule which is available only for authorized clients (so, our method is not applicable for publicly available Internet resources). This schedule is unique for each client connection and each entry in this schedule is being calculated dynamically on both edges of secured connection independently using a special pseudo-random function. To implement this requirement, during connection establishing between a new authorized client and the server, the client receives initial server's IP (which will be used for high level protocols on client side), pool of IP addresses (unordered set of IP address related to a set of ""edge"" routers) and unique session ID. The special network layer software installed on client's terminal changes destination IP address of the packet on an address from the IP pool according to value of a special pseudo-random function with the following arguments: session unique ID and time of packet's creation (value of timestamp field into TCP header). After that, this packet is being traversed to one of ""edge"" routers according to common switching protocols. The router checks (using the same pseudo-random function) that destination address is correct and, if yes, redirects this packet to real server IP or, otherwise, drops the packet. The same procedure is applied for server's responses to clients."|||||||

Such attack exploits a newly identified system vulnerability of n-tier web applications (millibottlenecks with sub-second duration and resource contention with strong dependencies among distributed nodes) with the goal of causing the long-tail latency problem of the target web application (e.g., 95th percentile response time > 1 second) and damaging the long-term business of the service provider, while all the system resources are far from saturation, making it difficult to trace the cause of performance degradation.|||||||
86|2905291|Mobile ad hoc networking (MANET) has been most popular research area for last decade. In MANET node (mobile node) is communicate with each other over wireless link where all nodes behave like both as host and router. In comparison with wired networks, mobile network is more vulnerable to security threat because of no centralized administration. One of the momentous routing protocols used in MANET is AODV (Ad hoc On demand Distance Vector) protocol. The Ad hoc On demand Distance Vector (AODV) protocol is compromised with its security by a various types of attacks due to malicious nodes present in the network. A hybrid approach is given for intrusion detection by removing malicious nodes during the route discovery process. The proposed approach increases the network performance in terms of PDR, throughput and end to end delay and security also.|||||||

In this paper, we propose a novel approach to detect anomalous network traffic based on graph theory concepts such as degree distribution, maximum degree and dK-2 distance. In this approach, we have used the traffic dispersion graphs (TDG) to model network traffic over time. We analyze differences of TDG graphs in time series to detect anomalies and introduce a method to identify attack patterns in anomalous traffic. The approach has been validated by using network traces from POSTECH and CAIDA.|||||||

90|2345503|The growing threat of cyber attacks, especially the DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service Attack) makes the IP Traceback very much prevalent to today's Internet security. IP Traceback is one of the security concerns that is associated with finding out the true origin of the attack/attacker. This process is very cumbersome as the IP addresses in most cases are spoofed addresses. The techniques that are used at present were designed for IPv4. Although IPv6 overcomes some of the security risks that could not be addressed at the protocol level, some problems are yet to be addressed. In addition to this, the prevailing traceback schemes need to be modified prior to their use in IPv6. Our approach in this paper focuses on a secure packet marking mechanism that would help in obtaining the marking which are authentic which a desired criteria for an improved marking scheme.|||||||
91|3342016|Many security analyses argue that the Software-Defined Network (SDNs) framework has many vulnerabilities because SDN provides malicious users an easy opportunity to overload network resources. Typically, the malicious user directs the attack towards the network layer, especially the controller plane which acts as the core of the network. However, the attack is redirected to the application layer when the attacker is defeated in the network layer. This paper proposes to extend the SDN controller with an external device to improve the SDN architecture and to protect the service level of the SDN components against malicious attacks. Simulation results show that the proposal successfully protects Web servers against Slow HTTP DDoS attacks.|||||||

94|1229293|"DoS attacks use IP spoofing to forge the source IP address of packets, and thereby hide the identity of the source. This makes it hard to defend against DoS attacks, so IP spoofing will still be used as an aggressive attack mechanism even under distributed attack environment. While many IP spoofing prevention techniques have been proposed, none have achieved widespread real-world use. One main reason is the lack of properties favoring incremental deployment, an essential component for the adoption of new technologies. A viable solution needs to be not only technically sound but also economically acceptable. An incrementally deploy-able protocol should have three properties: initial benefits for early adopters, incremental benefits for subsequent adopters, and effectiveness under partial deployment. Since no previous anti-spoofing solution satisfies all three of these properties, we propose a new mechanism called ""BGP Anti-Spoofing Extension"" (BASE). The BASE mechanism is an anti-spoofing protocol designed to fulfill the incremental deployment properties necessary for adoption in current Internet environments. Based on simulations we ran using a model of Internet AS connectivity, BASE shows desirable IP spoofing prevention capabilities under partial deployment. We find that just 30% deployment can drop about 97% of attack packets. Therefore, BASE not only provides adopters' benefit but also outperforms previous anti-spoofing mechanisms."|||||||

96|3149476|With the recent advances in software-defined networking (SDN), the multi-tenant data centers provide more efficient and flexible cloud platform to their subscribers. However, as the number, scale, and diversity of distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack is dramatically escalated in recent years, the availability of those platforms is still under risk. We note that the state-of-art DDoS protection architectures did not fully utilize the potential of SDN and network function virtualization (NFV) to mitigate the impact of attack traffic on data center network. Therefore, in this paper, we exploit the flexibility of SDN and NFV to propose FlexProtect, a flexible distributed DDoS protection architecture for multi-tenant data centers. In FlexProtect, the detection virtual network functions (VNFs) are placed near the service provider and the defense VNFs are placed near the edge routers for effectively detection and avoid internal bandwidth consumption, respectively. Based on the architecture, we then propose FP-SYN, an anti-spoofing SYN flood protection mechanism. The emulation and simulation results with real-world data demonstrates that, compared with the traditional approach, the proposed architecture can significantly reduce 46% of the additional routing path and save 60% internal bandwidth consumption. Moreover, the proposed detection mechanism for anti-spoofing can achieve 98% accuracy.|||||||

98|3148077|A Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack is an attempt to make an online service, a network, or even an entire organization, unavailable by saturating it with traffic from multiple sources. DDoS attacks are among the most common and most devastating threats that network defenders have to watch out for. DDoS attacks are becoming bigger, more frequent, and more sophisticated. Volumetric attacks are the most common types of DDoS attacks. A DDoS attack is considered volumetric, or high-rate, when within a short period of time it generates a large amount of packets or a high volume of traffic. High-rate attacks are well-known and have received much attention in the past decade; however, despite several detection and mitigation strategies have been designed and implemented, high-rate attacks are still halting the normal operation of information technology infrastructures across the Internet when the protection mechanisms are not able to cope with the aggregated capacity that the perpetrators have put together. With this in mind, the present paper aims to propose and test a distributed and collaborative architecture for online high-rate DDoS attack detection and mitigation based on an in-memory distributed graph data structure and unsupervised machine learning algorithms that leverage real-time streaming data and analytics. We have successfully tested our proposed mechanism using a real-world DDoS attack dataset at its original rate in pursuance of reproducing the conditions of an actual large scale attack.|||||||

The approach involves analyzing web server logs to identify popular pages using TF-IDF; building normal resource access profile; generating query of accessed resources; and applying LSI technique to determine the similarity between a given session and known good sessions. A high-level of dissimilarity triggers a DDoS attack warning. We apply the proposed approach to traffics generated from three PHP applications.

102|2147710|In July 2009, surprising large-scale Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attacks simultaneously targeted US and South Korean government, military, and commercial websites. Initial speculation was that this was well-designed cyber warfare from North Korea, but the truth is still unknown. What was even more surprising was how these critical infrastructures were still vulnerable after a decade of research on DDoS attacks. These particular incidents, the so-called 7.7 (July 7th) DDoS attacks, were highlighted not just because of their success but also because of their well-coordinated strategy. The 3.3 (March 3rd, 2011) DDoS attacks had similar characteristics to the 7.7 DDoS attacks, but they were not as successful because of the rapid vaccination of the zombie hosts. In this paper, we suggest that it is worthwhile to take a step back from the target side of the DDoS attacks and look at the problem in terms of network traffic from the attacker's side. We collected a unique large-scale sample of DDoS attack traffic from the two real-world incidents (not simulated), and we provide an analysis of traffic patterns from the perspective of the attacker's hosting network.|||||||

104|1582403|Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks especially distributed DoS (DDoS) attacks have become significant and increasing threats to the Internet. Huge efforts from both academia and industry have been made on detection and defense of DDoS attacks. However, most detection and defense schemes do not directly aim at protecting the victim of attacks itself (e.g., servers) but attack sources or intermediate network units. Although locating and identifying attacking sources are critical to stop attacks and for legal procedure, rapid and efficient predicting DDoS attacks to happen in the server is more important to reduce damage caused by attacks and even prevent attacks from happening. However, this part has not been addressed sufficiently in the literature. In this paper, we first briefly review research efforts on DDoS attacks, and then discuss a method to define and quantify attacks to severs based on available service rates. This is because the server is often the direct victim of DDoS attacks and the one-point failure of the entire service system. No matter whether there are attacks undergoing, if a sever is overloaded even by normal service requests, the effect imposed to a service system is equivalent to that of attacks. A prediction method for the available service rate of the protected server is then proposed, which applies the Auto Regressive Integrated Auto Regressive (ARIMA) model. Finally, we investigate the proposed prediction method to predict DDoS attacks through simulation studies with NS2. The simulation results show that the prediction algorithm is effective to predict most attacks.|||||||

106|3103151|Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks routinely disrupt access to critical services. Mitigation of these attacks often relies on planned over-provisioning or elastic provisioning of resources, and third-party monitoring, analysis, and scrubbing of network traffic. While volumetric attacks which saturate a victim's network are most common, non-volumetric, low and slow, DDoS attacks can achieve their goals without requiring high traffic volume by targeting vulnerable network protocols or protocol implementations. Non-volumetric attacks, unlike their noisy counterparts, require more sophisticated detection mechanisms, and typically have only post-facto and targeted protocol/application mitigations. In this paper, we introduce our work under the Adaptive Resource Management Enabling Deception (ARMED) effort, which is developing a network-level approach to automatically mitigate sophisticated DDoS attacks through deception-focused adaptive maneuvering. We describe the concept, implementation, and initial evaluation of the ARMED Network Actors (ANAs) that facilitate transparent interception, sensing, analysis, and mounting of adaptive responses that can disrupt the adversary's decision process.|||||||
107|511518|It is widely recognized that distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks can disrupt electronic commerce and cause large revenue losses. However, effective defenses continue to be mostly unavailable. We describe and evaluate VIPnet, a novel value-added network service for protecting e-commerce and other transaction-based sites from DDoS attacks. In VIPnet, e-merchants pay Internet Service Providers (ISPs) to carry the packets of the e-merchants' best clients (called VIPs) in a privileged class of service (CoS), protected from congestion, whether malicious or not, in the regular CoS. VIPnet rewards VIPs with not only better quality of service, but also greater availability. Because VIP rights are client- and server-specific, cannot be forged, are usage-limited, and are only replenished after successful client transactions (e.g., purchases), it is impractical for attackers to mount and sustain DDoS attacks against an e-merchant's VIPs. VIPnet can be deployed incrementally and does not require universal adoption. Experiments demonstrate VIPnet's benefits.|||||||

118|3041000|Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) is one of the most common but destructive kind of cyberattacks. The DDoS attack traffic vastly includes the SYN packets. To handle excessive DDoS traffic without large impact on the benign traffic, it is important to allocate sufficient resource for the defense. With the support from Network Function Virtualization (NFV) technology, this can be done in a significantly lower lower cost, with higher flexibility. In this work, we propose a DDoS defense mechanism based on Network Function Virtualization platform, which is capable to balance with the attack load. Our proposed mechanism uses dynamic network agents to intercept packets when the system experiences DDoS attack. In particular, we focus on the mechanism that deploys virtual agents dynamically according to the attack strength. The corresponding load-balancing algorithm dynamically determines the number of agents to allocate for defending the attack traffic. Our simulation results demonstrate that the mechanism can successfully defeat the DDoS attacks with different attack intensities, while it incurs minimal performance degradation on the benign traffic and keeps the increase in the server's response time sufficiently low compared to that of a successful DDoS attack.|||||||

The forwarding BF carried by each packet can encode either multicast tree or destination IP addresses, which are termed as tree oriented approach (TOA) and destination oriented approach (DOA), respectively.

However, attacker traceback in wireless multi-hop networks is a challenging problem, and existing attacker traceback schemes developed for the Internet cannot be directly applied to wireless multi-hop networks due to the peculiar characteristics of wireless multi-hop networks (e.g., dynamic/autonomous network topology, limited network/host resources such as memory and bandwidth).

The basic building blocks of our protocol framework consist of abnormality detection, abnormality characterization, abnormality searching, abnormality matching, and countermeasure. We show that our protocol framework successfully tracks down attacker (Avg. of 100% in DoS attacker traceback, avg. of 96% in DDoS attacker traceback) under diverse network environments (e.g., high background traffic, DDoS attack, and partial node compromise) with low communication, computation, and memory overhead.|||||||

They are not suitable for handling the new type of attack which is based on the application layer. In this paper, we introduce a new scheme to achieve early attack detection and filtering for the application-layer-based DDoS attack.

In order to reduce the computational amount introduced by the model's large state space, a novel forward algorithm is derived for the online implementation of the model based on the M-algorithm. Entropy of the user's HTTP request sequence fitting to the model is used as a criterion to measure the user's normality. Finally, experiments are conducted to validate our model and algorithm.|||||||

The lack of security in devices connected to the IoT is making them hot targets for cyber-criminals and strength of botnet attacks have increased drastically. Botnets are the technological backbones of multitudinous attacks including Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS), SPAM, identity theft and organizational spying. The 2016 Dyn cyber attack involved multiple DDoS attacks with an estimated throughput of 1.2 terabits per second; the attack is the largest DDoS attack on record.

135|3022230|Following the rise of modern networking, DDoS attacks are undeniably becoming more abusive. DNS amplification attack is a type of reflected DDoS attack that exploits DNS servers to distribute amplified responses. Detection-wise, related studies have focused on flow-based analysis as the alternative due to its feasibility within high-speed networks. However, fixed flow-monitoring application (i.e. NetFlow) is highly subjected to cache timeout hence lacks the support for a near real-time detection. Mitigation-wise, previous works have concentrated on the use of varying hardware appliances to handle excessive traffic. Nonetheless, such diversities introduce issues regarding flexibility and correlative control thus indicates the absence of centralized/autonomous mitigation. This paper proposed a substitute solution via sFlow with security-centric SDN to timely detect and reasonably mitigate DNS amplification attack.|||||||

137|2905159|Denial of Service (DoS)/ DDoS attack is a common and severe problem for network security researchers and practitioners. Attackers often generate attack traffic that behaves similar to normal network traffic using sophisticated attacking tools. Many intrusion detection systems fail to detect anomalous packets in real time. In this paper, we use a Multivariate Correlation Analysis (MCA) approach to distinguish attack traffic from normal traffic. This statistical measure is used to analyze the behavior of network traffic for attack detection. Since DDoS attack traffic behaves differently from legitimate network traffic, statistical properties of various parameters reflect the changed behavior of network traffic. We extract three basic parameters of network traffic, viz., entropy of source IPs, variation of source IPs and packet rate to analyze the behavior of network traffic during attack detection. The method is validated using several benchmark datasets.|||||||

153|2800005|DDoS attacks have become fatal attacks in recent times. There are large number of incidents which have been reported recently and caused heavy downtime and economic losses. Evolution of utility computing models like cloud computing and its adoption across enterprises is visible due to many promising features. Effects of DDoS attacks in cloud are no more similar to what they were in traditional fixed or on premise infrastructure. In addition to effects on the service, economic or sustainability effects are significant in the form of Economic Denial of Sustainability (EDoS) attacks. We argue that in a multi-tenant public cloud, multiple stakeholders are involved other than the victim server. Some of these important stakeholders are co-hosted virtual servers, physical server(s), network and, cloud service providers. We have shown through system analysis, experiments and simulations that these stakeholders are indeed affected though they are not the actual targets. Effects to other stakeholders include performance interference, web service performance, resource race, indirect EDoS, downtime and, business losses. Cloud scale simulations have revealed that overall energy consumption and no. of VM migrations are adversely affected due to DDoS/EDoS attacks. Losses to these stakeholders should be properly accounted and there is a need to devise methods to isolate these components well.|||||||

Our scheme is invoked only during attack times, is able to process the victims traffic separately without disturbing other traffic, is able to establish different attack signatures for different attacking sources, can prevent the attack traffic at the nearest router to the attacking system, has fast response time, is simple in its implementation and can be incrementally deployed. Hence we believe that the scheme proposed in this paper seems to be a promising approach to prevent distributed denial of service attacks|||||||
157|2995281|Traditionally, network and system configurations are static. Attackers have plenty of time to exploit the system's vulnerabilities and thus they are able to choose when to launch attacks wisely to maximize the damage. An unpredictable system configuration can significantly lift the bar for attackers to conduct successful attacks. Recent years, moving target defense (MTD) has been advocated for this purpose. An MTD mechanism aims to introduce dynamics to the system through changing its configuration continuously over time, which we call adaptations. Though promising, the dynamic system reconfiguration introduces overhead to the applications currently running in the system. It is critical to determine the right time to conduct adaptations and to balance the overhead afforded and the security levels guaranteed. This problem is known as the MTD timing problem. Little prior work has been done to investigate the right time in making adaptations. In this paper, we take the first step to both theoretically and experimentally study the timing problem in moving target defenses. For a broad family of attacks including DDoS attacks and cloud covert channel attacks, we model this problem as a renewal reward process and propose an optimal algorithm in deciding the right time to make adaptations with the objective of minimizing the long-term cost rate. In our experiments, both DDoS attacks and cloud covert channel attacks are studied. Simulations based on real network traffic traces are conducted and we demonstrate that our proposed algorithm outperforms known adaptation schemes.|||||||

162|2619291|The need to keep an attacker oblivious of an attack mitigation effort is a very important component of a defense against denial of services (DoS) and distributed denial of services (DDoS) attacks because it helps to dissuade attackers from changing their attack patterns. Conceptually, DDoS mitigation can be achieved by two components. The first is a decoy server that provides a service function or receives attack traffic as a substitute for a legitimate server. The second is a decoy network that restricts attack traffic to the peripheries of a network, or which reroutes attack traffic to decoy servers. In this paper, we propose the use of a two-stage map table extension Locator/ID Separation Protocol (LISP) to realize a decoy network. We also describe and demonstrate how LISP can be used to implement an oblivious DDoS mitigation mechanism by adding a simple extension on the LISP MapServer. Together with decoy servers, this method can terminate DDoS traffic on the ingress end of an LISP-enabled network. We verified the effectiveness of our proposed mechanism through simulated DDoS attacks on a simple network topology.

The approach aims to minimize collateral damage by providing bandwidth isolation between traffic flows. The proposed solution is readily deployable using existing router mechanisms and does not rely on any unauthenticated packet header information. Our extensive evaluation across two large commercial backbone networks, using both distributed and targeted attacks, shows that up to 95.5% of the network could suffer collateral damage, but our solution was able to significantly reduce the amount of collateral damage by up to 97.58% in terms of the number of packets dropped and 90.36% in terms of the number of flows with packet loss.

Whereas DNS-based redirection requires a complex global traffic manager, anycast depends on BGP to direct a client to a CDN front-end. Anycast is simple to operate, scalable, and naturally resilient to DDoS attacks. This simplicity, however, comes at the cost of precise control of client redirection. We examine the performance implications of using anycast in a global, latency-sensitive, CDN. We analyze millions of client-side measurements from the Bing search service to capture anycast versus unicast performance to nearby front-ends. We find that anycast usually performs well despite the lack of precise control but that it directs roughly 20% of clients to a suboptimal front-end. We also show that the performance of these clients can be improved through a simple history-based prediction scheme.|||||||

184|3078491|In Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks, an attacker tries to disable a service with a flood of seemingly legitimate requests from multiple devices; this is usually accompanied by a sharp spike in the number of distinct IP addresses / flows accessing the system in a short time frame. Hence, the number of distinct elements over sliding windows is a fundamental signal in DDoS identification. Additionally, assessing whether a specific flow has recently accessed the system, known as the Set Membership problem, can help us identify the attacking parties. Here, we show how to extend the functionality of a state of the art algorithm for set membership over a W elements sliding window.

Botnets are versatile, they remain the most powerful attack platform by constantly and continuously adopting new techniques and strategies in the arms race against various detection schemes. Thus, it is essential to understand the latest of the botnets in a timely manner so that the insights can be utilized in developing more efficient defenses. In this work, we conduct a measurement study on some of the most active botnets on the Internet based on a public dataset collected over a period of seven months by a monitoring entity. We first examine and compare the attacking capabilities of different families of today's active botnets.

Among the proposed methods are two which are widely accepted, but with known limitations: one based on a static fanout ratio, and another on principal component analysis (PCA). We introduce a two-step procedure based on Functional PCA and k-means clustering which we argue provides significantly better robustness and data-driven applicability. We validate and compare using synthetic datasets with ""ground truth"" about anomalies on FTP and HTTP port traffic flows; our method identifies all scanners. We also compare approaches using NTP flow data prior to a reflective DDoS attack in 2014, providing a real-world example to illustrate the deficiencies of existing approaches and how they are addressed by our functional framework procedure.

Our approach provides accuracy guarantees and is the only space-efficient solution that offers such capabilities. Finally, we demonstrate how the algorithm can be used to accurately pinpoint the beginning of a realistic DDoS attack.|||||||
189|2987446|"Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attacks continue to be a major threat on the Internet today. DDoS attacks overwhelm target services with requests or other traffic, causing requests from legitimate users to be shut out. A common defense against DDoS is to replicate a service in multiple physical locations/sites. If all sites announce a common prefix, BGP will associate users around the Internet with a nearby site, defining the catchment of that site. Anycast defends against DDoS both by increasing aggregate capacity across many sites, and allowing each site's catchment to contain attack traffic, leaving other sites unaffected. IP anycast is widely used by commercial CDNs and for essential infrastructure such as DNS, but there is little evaluation of anycast under stress. This paper provides the first evaluation of several IP anycast services under stress with public data. Our subject is the Internet's Root Domain Name Service, made up of 13 independently designed services (""letters"", 11 with IP anycast) running at more than 500 sites. Many of these services were stressed by sustained traffic at 100× normal load on Nov. 30 and Dec. 1, 2015. We use public data for most of our analysis to examine how different services respond to stress, and identify two policies: sites may absorb attack traffic, containing the damage but reducing service to some users, or they may withdraw routes to shift both good and bad traffic to other sites. We study how these deployment policies resulted in different levels of service to different users during the events. We also show evidence of collateral damage on other services located near the attacks."|||||||

The design and implementation is focused on simplicity of abstraction and extensibility. Moreover, its modular architecture allows operators to dynamically customize running simulations. To demonstrate its strengths we present cases studies that focus on examining security-centric problem domains. In particular, we present an analysis of worm propagation modeling for worms with varying target selection algorithms on topologies representing a few million hosts. Additionally, we examine the use of countermeasures such as aggregate congestion control as a defense against DDoS attacks, and present analysis for a variant called direct-Pushback. Lastly, we provide an empirical analysis of the computational and bandwidth overhead induced by proposed security extensions to DNS. These experiments hopefully illustrate that Simnet is not only scalable and efficient, but provides a viable platform for prototyping and analyzing non-trivial security protocols ? a task which we argue cannot be easily accomplished elsewhere.|||||||

198|986658|Currently, there is no effective defense against large-scale distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks. While numerous DDoS defense systems exist that offer excellent protection from specific attack types and scenarios, they can frequently be defeated by an attacker aware of their weaknesses. A necessary requirement for successful DDoS defense is wide deployment, but none of these systems can guarantee wide deployment simply because deployment depends more on market and social aspects than on the technical performance of the system.To successfully handle the DDoS threat we must abandon the current paradigm---the design of defense systems that operate in isolation---and shift toward a new paradigm, a distributed framework of heterogeneous systems that cooperate to achieve an effective defense. Heterogeneity is dictated by two major factors. First, the necessary requirements for a successful defense are detection, response and traffic differentiation. These requirements must be met at disjoint points in the Internet and require a disjoint set of functionalities from the defense systems. Second, heterogeneity is dictated by the current state of the DDoS defense field in which numerous systems exist that can offer similar performance and compete for market share. In this paper we show how the paradigm shift can be accomplished quickly and painlessly through the design of DefCOM, a distributed framework that enables the exchange of information and services between existing defense nodes.|||||||

Most of the Researchers dedicate in analyzing the random domains used for DGA (Domain Generation Algorithm) malware C&C communication rather than the DNS water torture attack.

Based on a month of real-world DNS traffic, we find that, first, the volume of the DNS water torture attack is significantly larger than the volume of disposable domains and DGA queries. Second, the character distribution of domains generated in the DNS water torture attacks are more random than disposable domains and DGA domains. Third, the client IP launching the DNS water torture attack are all random generated fake addresses. Fourth, the victims are themselves lawbreaker, e.g., pornographic website and gambling website. At last, we give some advices based on the analysis result to mitigate the DNS water torture attack.|||||||

Detecting Botnets is a difficult task in due to the complexity and performance issues when analyzing the huge amount of data from real large-scale networks. In major Botnet malware, the use of Domain Generation Algorithms allows to decrease possibility to be detected using white list - blacklist scheme and thus DGA Botnets have higher survival. This paper proposes a DGA Botnet detection scheme based on DNS traffic analysis which utilizes semantic measures such as entropy, meaning the level of the domain, frequency of n-gram appearances and Mahalanobis distance for domain classification. The proposed method is an improvement of Phoenix botnet detection mechanism, where in the classification phase, the modified Mahalanobis distance is used instead of the original for classification. The clustering phase is based on modified k-means algorithm for archiving better effectiveness. The effectiveness of the proposed method was measured and compared with Phoenix, Linguistic and SVM Light methods.

This problem is central to combating abusive traffic, such as DDoS attacks, ad click fraud and email spam. We share our experience building a general framework at Google for estimating the number of users behind IPs, called hereinafter the sizes of the IPs. The primary goal of this framework is combating abusive traffic without violating the user privacy. The estimation techniques produce statistically sound estimates of sizes relying solely on passively mining aggregated application log data, without probing machines or deploying active content like Java applets. This paper also explores using the estimated sizes to detect and filter abusive traffic. The proposed framework was used to build and deploy an ad click fraud filter at Google. The first 50M clicks tagged by the filter had a significant recall of all tagged clicks, and their false positive rate was below 1.4%. For the sake of comparison, we simulated a naive IP-based filter that does not consider the sizes of the IPs. To reach a comparable recall, the naive filter's false positive rate was 37% due to aggressive tagging.|||||||

The advantages of cloud computing are lucrative for well-established organizations looking to reduce infrastructure cost overheads. However, the users are not quite confident in entrusting their data to the cloud due to security threats and risks perceived in the cloud domain. Issues involving privacy requirements for the cloud and best practices in the cloud are suggested in this paper. Although the cloud provider ensures security in the cloud yet the flow of data, storage location, data computing process and security breaches are not transparent to the cloud customer. This distrust and lack of control on data is a major hindrance for potential cloud customers in adopting the cloud models for their businesses. Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs) are widely used to detect malicious activities. However existing solutions with IDSs involving DDoS and other non-detectable events may not be suitable in applying to the cloud due to distributed data storage and a major shift in Internet access mechanisms offered by cloud providers. Hence there is a strong need to analyze an appropriate IDS to counter DDoS attacks in the cloud. In this paper we propose a novel framework for data security in the cloud using Collaborative Intrusion Detection (CIDS) scheme. The benefits of CIDS scheme in cloud are enabling the end user to get comprehensive information in the event of a distributed attack on cloud.|||||||

Cyber criminals are using advanced malware such as polymorphic botnets for participating in our everyday online activities and trying to access the desired information in terms of personal details, credit card numbers and banking credentials. Polymorphic botnet attack is one of the biggest attacks in the history of cybercrime and currently, millions of computers are infected by the botnet clients over the world.

The reliability of the platform is threatened by anomalous access behaviors such as resource abuse, DDoS attacks etc. Detecting anomalous behaviors to access the cloud service platform is an essential task. In this paper, an anomaly detection method based on Max-min distance and Support vector data description (MMD-SVDD) is proposed. The method identifies anomalous user access behaviors using CPU/memory/disk/network related system resource metrics. It firstly uses MMD to divide servers in the cloud service platform into multi-clusters. The servers in each of the clusters have similar running environment and can share an anomaly detection model. This process can effectively reduce the detection scale and system resource consumption. Then, aiming at the problem of incomplete abnormal data samples, the anomaly detection models are built based on SVDD algorithm, which utilizes normal data samples to construct a hypersphere for each cluster. Finally, the anomalous behavior is identified via judging whether the target data falls outside the hypersphere. The method is applied in cloud service platform and the result shows that it can accurately identity anomalies with lower system resource consumption.|||||||
209|2109151|The spread of a source host is the number of distinct destinations that it has sent packets to during a measurement period. A spread estimator is a software/hardware module on a router that inspects the arrival packets and estimates the spread of each source. It has important applications in detecting port scans and distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks, measuring the infection rate of a worm, assisting resource allocation in a server farm, determining popular Web contents for caching, to name a few. The main technical challenge is to fit a spread estimator in a fast but small memory (such as SRAM) in order to operate it at the line speed in a high-speed network. In this paper, we design a new spread estimator that delivers good performance in tight memory space where all existing estimators no longer work. The new estimator not only achieves space compactness, but operates more efficiently than the existing ones. Its accuracy and efficiency come from a new method for data storage, called virtual vectors, which allow us to measure and remove the errors in spread estimation. We also propose several ways to enhance the range of spread values that the estimator can measure. We perform extensive experiments on real Internet traces to verify the effectiveness of the new estimator.|||||||

There are various methods that have been proposed to fight spam, from IP-based blocking to filtering incoming email-messages. However it seems that it is impossible to overcome this problem as the number of email-messages that are considered spam is increasing.

By extending SMTP to pull messages instead of receiving them an attempt to stem the flood of spam is made. The pull-based approach works without involvement of the end-users.

213|1029627|The monitoring of unused Internet address space has been shown to be an effective method for characterizing Internet threats including Internet worms and DDOS attacks. Because there are no legitimate hosts in an unused address block, traffic must be the result of misconfiguration, backscatter from spoofed source addresses, or scanning from worms and other probing. This paper extends previous work characterizing traffic seen at specific unused address blocks by examining differences observed between these blocks. While past research has attempted to extrapolate the results from a small number of blocks to represent global Internet traffic, we present evidence that distributed address blocks observe dramatically different traffic patterns. This work uses a network of blackhole sensors which are part of the Internet Motion Sensor (IMS) collection infrastructure. These sensors are deployed in networks belonging to service providers, large enterprises, and academic institutions representing a diverse sample of the IPv4 address space. We demonstrate differences in traffic observed along three dimensions: over all protocols and services, over a specific protocol and service, and over a particular worm signature. This evidence is then combined with additional experimentation to build a list of sensor properties providing plausible explanations for these differences. Using these properties, we conclude with recommendations for the understanding the implications of sensor placement.|||||||

This gives persistent attackers (e.g. eavesdroppers and DDoS attackers) plenty of time to study the network and identify the vulnerable (critical) links to plan devastating and stealthy attacks. Recently, Moving Target Defense (MTD) based approaches have been proposed to to defend against DoS attacks. However, MTD based approaches for route mutation are oriented towards re-configuring the parameters in Local Area Networks (LANs), and do not provide any protection against infrastructure level attacks, which inherently limits their use for mission critical services over the Internet infrastructure.

A successful cross-VM escape attack in the virtualization layer combined with cross-layer penetration in the device layer, which we define as an Advanced Persistent Escaper (APE), poses a great threat. Therefore, the development of detection and rejection methods for APEs across multiple layers in IIoT is an open issue. To the best of our knowledge, less effective methods are established, especially for vulnerability exploitation in the virtualization layer and backdoor leverage in the device layer.

So, the need of source-based defense mechanism against such attacks is pressing.

Then we designed a simple detection algorithm based on statistical inference model and response scheme through the abilities of SDN. Finally, we developed an application to realize our idea and also tested its effect on emulation network with real network traffic. The result shows that our mechanism could effectively detect DDoS flooding attack originated in SDN environment and identify attack flows for avoiding the harm of attack spreading to target or outside. We advocate the advantages of SDN in the area of defending DDoS attacks, because it is difficult and laborious to organize selfish and undisciplined traditional distributed network to confront well collaborative DDoS flooding attacks.|||||||

The proposed TDCD model starts with real-world cyber breaches including the Target Corporation breach, the Anthem Inc. breach, and selected Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks. Students look into the details of these attacks and learn how these attacks took place from the beginning to the end. During the process of case analysis, a list of security topics reflecting different aspects of these breaches is introduced. Through guided in-class discussion, selected readings and hands-on lab assignments, student learning in lecture will be reinforced. Overall, the entire cybersecurity course is taught top-down and driven by real-world breach cases. The proposed TDCD model is ideal for teaching cybersecurity. First, the new model can easily draw students' attention and interest with real-world cases. Second, the new model can help instructors select important and timely cybersecurity topics from a wide range of options. Third, the new model can improve student learning outcomes, particularly help students gain a holistic view of security and learn socio-technical factors.|||||||
223|3301614|Distributed Denial of Service attack (DDoS) is recognized to be one of the most catastrophic attacks against various digital communication entities. Software-defined networking (SDN) is an emerging technology for computer networks that uses open protocols for controlling switches and routers placed at the network edges by using specialized open programmable interfaces. In this article, a detailed study on DDoS threats prevalent in SDN is presented. First, SDN features are examined from the perspective of security, and then a discussion on SDN security features is done. Further, two viewpoints on protecting networks against DDoS attacks are presented. In the first view, SDN utilizes its abilities to secure conventional networks. In the second view, SDN may become a victim of the threat itself because of the centralized control mechanism. The main focus of this research work is on discovering critical security implications in SDN while reviewing the current ongoing research studies. By emphasizing the available state-of-the-art techniques, an extensive review of the advancement of SDN security is provided to the research and IT communities.|||||||

225|1514018|Tracing attack packets to their sources, known as IP traceback, is an important step to counter distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks. In this paper, we propose a novel packet logging based (i.e., hash-based) traceback scheme that requires an order of magnitude smaller processing and storage cost than the hash-based scheme proposed by Snoeren et al. [1], thereby being able to scalable to much higher link speed (e.g., OC-768). The base-line idea of our approach is to sample and log a small percentage (e.g., 3.3%) of packets. The challenge of this low sampling rate is that much more sophisticated techniques need to be used for traceback. Our solution is to construct the attack tree using the correlation between the attack packets sampled by neighboring routers. The scheme using naive independent random sampling does not perform well due to the low correlation between the packets sampled by neighboring routers. We invent a sampling scheme that improves this correlation and the overall efficiency significantly. Another major contribution of this work is that we introduce a novel information-theoretic framework for our traceback scheme to answer important questions on system parameter tuning and the fundamental tradeoff between the resource used for traceback and the traceback accuracy. Simulation results based on real-world network topologies (e.g., Skitter) match very well with results from the information-theoretic analysis. The simulation results also demonstrate that our traceback scheme can achieve high accuracy, and scale very well to a large number of attackers (e.g., 5000+).|||||||

227|3230837|In this short paper, we take a first step towards empirically assessing Internet-wide malicious activities generated from and targeted towards Internet-scale business sectors (i.e., financial, health, education, etc.) and critical infrastructure (i.e., utilities, manufacturing, government, etc.). Facilitated by an innovative and a collaborative large-scale effort, we have conducted discussions with numerous Internet entities to obtain rare and private information related to allocated IP blocks pertaining to the aforementioned sectors and critical infrastructure. To this end, we employ such information to attribute Internet-scale maliciousness to such sectors and realms, in an attempt to provide an in-depth analysis of the global cyber situational posture. We draw upon close to 16.8 TB of darknet data to infer probing activities (typically generated by malicious/infected hosts) and DDoS backscatter, from which we distill IP addresses of victims. By executing week-long measurements, we observed an alarming number of more than 11,000 probing machines and 300 DDoS attack victims hosted by critical sectors. We also generate rare insights related to the maliciousness of various business sectors, including financial, which typically do not report their hosted and targeted illicit activities for reputation-preservation purposes. While we treat the obtained results with strict confidence due to obvious sensitivity reasons, we postulate that such generated cyber threat intelligence could be shared with sector/critical infrastructure operators, backbone networks and Internet service providers to contribute to the overall threat remediation objective.|||||||
228|3134637|Most websites, services, and applications have come to rely on Internet services (e.g., DNS, CDN, email, WWW, etc.) offered by third parties. Although employing such services generally improves reliability and cost-effectiveness, it also creates dependencies on service providers, which may expose websites to additional risks, such as DDoS attacks or cascading failures. As cloud services are becoming more popular, an increasing percentage of the overall Internet ecosystem relies on a decreasing number of highly popular services. In our general effort to assess the security risk for a given entity, and motivated by the effects of recent service disruptions, we perform a large-scale analysis of passive and active DNS datasets including more than 2.5 trillion queries in order to discover the dependencies between websites and Internet services.|||||||
229|3323084|Network traffic measurement is important for network management, including bandwidth management to mitigate network congestion, and security management to detect DDOS attacks and worm spreading. However, with the explosive volume of network data and the fast transmission speed of network packets (in giga or even tera bps), it is a challenging task to measure the size of each network flow both accurately and memory-efficiently, using the size-limited SRAM memory of line card. Therefore, many sublinear space algorithms for processing data streams have been proposed, such as CountMin (CM), Count Sketch (CS) and Virtual Active Counters (VAC), which achieve extreme memory compactness by providing probabilistic guarantees on flow size measurement accuracy. However, these existing algorithms can still be greatly improved as to the performance of both online recording and querying the per-flow size, which is needed for online tracking heavy hitters. Our paper proposes a highly compact and efficient counter architecture, called CountMin virtual active counter (CM-VAC), which provides more accurate measurement results than CM and CS under a very tight memory space. We also achieve higher query speed than VAC by modifying its query policy. We demonstrate the superior performance of our algorithm by both experimental results and theoretical analysis based on CAIDA network traces.|||||||

231|1064256|There is a growing interest in discovery of internet topology at the interface level. A new generation of highly distributed measurement systems is currently being deployed. Unfortunately, the research community has not examined the problem of how to perform such measurements efficiently and in a network-friendly manner. In this paper we make two contributions toward that end. First, we show that standard topology discovery methods (e.g., skitter) are quite inefficient, repeatedly probing the same interfaces. This is a concern, because when scaled up, such methods will generate so much traffic that they will begin to resemble DDoS attacks. We measure two kinds of redundancy in probing (intra- and inter-monitor) and show that both kinds are important. We show that straightforward approaches to addressing these two kinds of redundancy must take opposite tacks, and are thus fundamentally in conflict. Our second contribution is to propose and evaluate Doubletree, an algorithm that reduces both types of redundancy simultaneously on routers and end systems. The key ideas are to exploit the tree-like structure of routes to and from a single point in order to guide when to stop probing, and to probe each path by starting near its midpoint. Our results show that Doubletree can reduce both types of measurement load on the network dramatically, while permitting discovery of nearly the same set of nodes and links.|||||||
232|1514073|Countering distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks is becoming ever more challenging with the vast resources and techniques increasingly available to attackers. In this paper, we consider sophisticated attacks that are protocol-compliant, non-intrusive, and utilize legitimate application-layer requests to overwhelm system resources. We characterize application-layer resource attacks as either request flooding, asymmetric, or repeated one-shot, on the basis of the application workload parameters that they exploit. To protect servers from these attacks, we propose a counter-mechanism namely DDoS Shield that consists of a suspicion assignment mechanism and a DDoS-resilient scheduler. In contrast to prior work, our suspicion mechanism assigns a continuous value as opposed to a binary measure to each client session, and the scheduler utilizes these values to determine if and when to schedule a session's requests. Using testbed experiments on a web application, we demonstrate the potency of these resource attacks and evaluate the efficacy of our counter-mechanism. For instance, we mount an asymmetric attack which overwhelms the server resources, increasing the response time of legitimate clients from 0.3 seconds to 40 seconds. Under the same attack scenario, DDoS Shield improves the victims' performance to 1.5 seconds.|||||||

234|2046676|Initial threat modeling and security research on the public cloud model has primarily focused on the confidentiality and integrity of data transferred, processed, and stored in the cloud. Little attention has been paid to the external threat sources that have the capability to affect the financial viability, hence the long-term availability, of services hosted in the public cloud. Similar to an application-layer DDoS attack, a Fraudulent Resource Consumption (FRC) attack is a much more subtle attack carried out over a longer duration of time. The objective of the attacker is to exploit the utility pricing model which governs the resource usage in the cloud model by fraudulently consuming web content with the purpose of depriving the victim of their long-term economic availability of hosting publicly accessible web content in the cloud. In this paper, we thoroughly describe the FRC attack and discuss why current application-layer DDoS detection schemes are not applicable to a more subtle attack. We propose three detection metrics that together form the criteria for identifying a FRC attack from that of normal web activity. Experimental results based on three plausible attack scenarios show that an attacker without knowledge of the web log has a difficult time mimicking the self-similar and consistent request semantics of normal web activity.|||||||

In this paper, we argue that systematic analysis of traffic characteristics of P2P systems can reveal a wealth of information about their behavior, and highlight potential undesirable activities that such systems may exhibit. As a first step to this end, we present an offline and semi-automated approach to detect undesirable behavior. Our analysis is applied on real traffic traces collected from a Point-of-Presence (PoP) of a national-wide ISP in which over 70% of the total traffic is due to eMule [19], a popular P2P file-sharing system. Flow-level measurements are aggregated into ""samples"" referring to the activity of each host during a time interval. We then employ a clustering technique to automatically and coarsely identify similar behavior across samples, and extensively use domain knowledge to interpret and analyze the resulting clusters. Our analysis shows several examples of undesirable behavior including evidence of DDoS attacks exploiting live P2P clients, significant amounts of unwanted traffic that may harm network performance, and instances where the performance of participating peers may be subverted due to maliciously deployed servers. Identification of such patterns can benefit network operators, P2P system developers, and actual end-users."|||||||
241|2978306|Volumetric attacks, which overwhelm the bandwidth of a destination, are amongst the most common DDoS attacks today. One practical approach to addressing these attacks is to redirect all destination traffic (e.g., via DNS or BGP) to a third-party, DDoS-protection-as-a-service provider (e.g., CloudFlare) that is well provisioned and equipped with filtering mechanisms to remove attack traffic before passing the remaining benign traffic to the destination. An alternative approach is based on the concept of network capabilities, whereby source sending rates are determined by receiver consent, in the form of capabilities enforced by the network. While both third-party scrubbing services and network capabilities can be effective at reducing unwanted traffic at an overwhelmed destination, DDoS-protection-as-a-service solutions outsource all of the scheduling decisions (e.g., fairness, priority and attack identification) to the provider, while capability-based solutions require extensive modifications to existing infrastructure to operate. In this paper we introduce MiddlePolice, which seeks to marry the deployability of DDoS-protection-as-a-service solutions with the destination-based control of network capability systems. We show that by allowing feedback from the destination to the provider, MiddlePolice can effectively enforce destination-chosen policies, while requiring no deployment from unrelated parties.|||||||

252|1404806|Denial of service (DoS)/Distributed DoS (DDoS) attack is an eminent threat to an authentication server, which is used to guard access to firewalls, virtual private networks and wired/wireless networks. The major problem is that an authentication server needs to verify whether a request is from a legitimate user and if intensive computation and/or memory resources are needed for verifying a request, then DoS/DDoS attack is feasible. In this paper, a new protocol called Identity-Based Privacy-Protected Access Control Filter (IPACF) is proposed to counter DoS/DDoS attack. This protocol is an improvement of IDF (Identity-Based Dynamic Access Control Filter). The proposed protocol is stateless because it does not create a state for an authentication request unless the request is from a legitimate user. Moreover, the IPACF is stateless for both user and authentication server since a user and responder authenticate each other. A filter value, which is generated by pre-shared secrets, is sent in a frame and checked to see if the request is legitimate. Note that the process of checking filter value is not intensive computation. The filter value is tabulated in a table with user identity so that a filter value represents a user's identity and only the legitimate user and authentication server can figure out the identity. When a filter value is from a legitimate source, a new filter value will be generated for the next frame. Consequently, the filter value is changed for every frame. Thus the privacy of both user and server are protected.|||||||

The main goal of DoS defenses is to neutralize this effect, and to quickly and fully restore quality of various services to levels acceptable by the users. To objectively evaluate a variety of proposed defenses we must be able to precisely measure damage created by an attack, i.e., the denial of service itself, in controlled testbed experiments. Current evaluation methodologies measure DoS damage superficially and partially by measuring a single traffic parameter, such as duration, loss or throughput, and showing divergence during the attack from the baseline case. These measures do not consider quality-of-service requirements of different applications and how they map into specific thresholds for various traffic parameters.

261|1023661|Wireless networks are built upon a shared medium that makes it easy for adversaries to launch denial of service (DoS) attacks. One form of denial of service is targeted at preventing sources from communicating. These attacks can be easily accomplished by an adversary by either bypassing MAC-layer protocols, or emitting a radio signal targeted at jamming a particular channel. In this paper we present two strategies that may be employed by wireless devices to evade a MAC/PHY-layer jamming-style wireless denial of service attack. The first strategy, channel surfing, is a form of spectral evasion that involves legitimate wireless devices changing the channel that they are operating on. The second strategy, spatial retreats, is a form of spatial evasion whereby legitimate mobile devices move away from the locality of the DoS emitter. We study both of these strategies for three broad wireless communication scenarios: two-party radio communication, an infrastructured wireless network, and an ad hoc wireless network. We evaluate several of our proposed strategies and protocols through ns-2 simulations and experiments on the Berkeley mote platform.|||||||

Optimal MIMO communication is achieved by applying a waterfilling solution over the parallel subchannels associated with the channel matrix between a transmitter and receiver.

In this paper, we propose to address these problems by presenting a taxonomy for classifying DoS characteristics and concerns new to CPS systems. Our taxonomy is motivated by a number of experimental results that were obtained using our CPS middleware implementation and that highlight fundamental DoS concerns in this domain. Finally, we discuss some example DoS attacks in detail with respect to our taxonomy and experimental results. We find that localization, message content complexity, and filter statefulness are the key CPS characteristics to consider when designing DoS resilient CPS systems.|||||||

267|1030118|"We present <i>congestion puzzles</i> (CP), a new countermeasure to bandwidth-exhaustion attacks. Like other defenses based on client puzzles, CP attempts to force attackers to invest vast resources in order to effectively perform denial-of-service attacks. Unlike previous puzzle-based approaches, however, ours is the first designed for the bandwidth-exhaustion attacks that are common at the network (IP) layer. At the core of CP is an elegant distributed puzzle mechanism that permits routers to cooperatively impose and check puzzles. We demonstrate through analysis and simulation that CP can effectively defend networks from flooding attacks without relying on the formulation of attack signatures to filter traffic. Moreover, as many such attacks are conducted by ""zombie"" computers that have been silently commandeered without the knowledge of their owners, the overheads that CP imposes on heavily engaged zombies can increase the likelihood that the computer's owner detects the compromise and takes action to remedy it."|||||||

However, two important issues, namely multicast denial-of-service and access control, have been ignored in previous proposals. In this paper, we propose two Internet Protocol multicast authentication schemes by making use of the multicast tree as an essential authentication mechanism. Our schemes are efficient and immune to multicast denial-of-service attack. They allow the receivers to immediately authenticate the packets regardless of the packet loss characteristics of the underlying network.|||||||

Our metrics are ideal for testbed experimentation, since necessary traffic parameters are extracted from packet traces gathered during an experiment.|||||||
270|3274727|This paper presents DeDoS, a novel platform for mitigating asymmetric DoS attacks. These attacks are particularly challenging since even attackers with limited resources can exhaust the resources of well-provisioned servers. DeDoS offers a framework to deploy code in a highly modular fashion. If part of the application stack is experiencing a DoS attack, DeDoS can massively replicate only the affected component, potentially across many machines. This allows scaling of the impacted resource separately from the rest of the application stack, so that resources can be precisely added where needed to combat the attack. Our evaluation results show that DeDoS incurs reasonable overheads in normal operations, and that it significantly outperforms standard replication techniques when defending against a range of asymmetric attacks.|||||||
271|1028812|Current intrusion detection and prevention systems seek to detect a wide class of network intrusions (e.g., DoS attacks, worms, port scans)at network vantage points. Unfortunately, all the IDS systems we know of keep per-connection or per-flow state. Thus it is hardly surprising that IDS systems (other than signature detection mechanisms) have not scaled to multi-gigabit speeds. By contrast, note that both router lookups and fair queuing have scaled to high speeds using <i>aggregation</i> via prefix lookups or DiffServ. Thus in this paper, we initiate research into the question as to whether one can detect attacks without keeping per-flow state. We will show that such aggregation, while making fast implementations possible, immediately cause two problems. First, aggregation can cause <i>behavioral</i> aliasing where, for example, good behaviors can aggregate to look like bad behaviors. Second, aggregated schemes are susceptible to spoofing by which the intruder sends attacks that have appropriate aggregate behavior. We examine a wide variety of DoS attacks and show that several categories (bandwidth based, claim-and-hold, host scanning) can be scalably detected. By contrast, it appears that stealthy port-scanning cannot be scalably detected without keeping per-flow state.|||||||

273|3103151|Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks routinely disrupt access to critical services. Mitigation of these attacks often relies on planned over-provisioning or elastic provisioning of resources, and third-party monitoring, analysis, and scrubbing of network traffic. While volumetric attacks which saturate a victim's network are most common, non-volumetric, low and slow, DDoS attacks can achieve their goals without requiring high traffic volume by targeting vulnerable network protocols or protocol implementations. Non-volumetric attacks, unlike their noisy counterparts, require more sophisticated detection mechanisms, and typically have only post-facto and targeted protocol/application mitigations. In this paper, we introduce our work under the Adaptive Resource Management Enabling Deception (ARMED) effort, which is developing a network-level approach to automatically mitigate sophisticated DDoS attacks through deception-focused adaptive maneuvering. We describe the concept, implementation, and initial evaluation of the ARMED Network Actors (ANAs) that facilitate transparent interception, sensing, analysis, and mounting of adaptive responses that can disrupt the adversary's decision process.|||||||

276|1540357|There exist many studies against reactive jamming attacks, however, these methods, i.e. frequency hopping or channel surfing, require excessive computational capabilities on wireless devices which are serious side effects in wireless sensor networks. To avoid the problems in existing methods, we propose a novel approach against reactive jamming attacks by identifying the trigger nodes, whose transmissions activate any reactive jammers. The identification of these trigger nodes can help us (i) carefully design a better routing protocol by switching these nodes into only receivers to avoid activating jammers and (ii) locate the jammers based on the trigger nodes, thus providing an alternative mechanism against reactive jamming attacks. In this paper, we provide an efficient method to identify the trigger nodes by utilizing the group testing techniques and minimum collection of disjoint disk covers to reduce the message and computational overhead. The theoretical analysis and experimental results show that our solution performs extremely well in terms of time and message complexities, which in turn provides a good approach to defend reactive jamming attacks.|||||||

Results of simulation studies are presented. Our approach does not require changes to the Internet routers or protocols.

In this paper, we quantify the protection that congestion pricing affords against DoS attacks, even for powerful attackers that can control their packets' routes. Specifically, we model the limits on the resources available to the attackers in three different ways and, in each case, quantify the maximum amount of damage they can cause as a function of their resource bounds. In addition, we show that congestion pricing is provably superior to fair queueing in attack resilience.|||||||

281|1851214|Denial of Service (DoS) attacks frequently happen on the Internet, paralyzing Internet services and causing millions of dollars of financial loss. This work presents NetFence, a scalable DoS-resistant network architecture. NetFence uses a novel mechanism, secure congestion policing feedback, to enable robust congestion policing inside the network. Bottleneck routers update the feedback in packet headers to signal congestion, and access routers use it to police senders' traffic. Targeted DoS victims can use the secure congestion policing feedback as capability tokens to suppress unwanted traffic. When compromised senders and receivers organize into pairs to congest a network link, NetFence provably guarantees a legitimate sender its fair share of network resources without keeping per-host state at the congested link. We use a Linux implementation, ns-2 simulations, and theoretical analysis to show that NetFence is an effective and scalable DoS solution: it reduces the amount of state maintained by a congested router from per-host to at most per-(Autonomous System).|||||||

We analyze all the known decompression quines by studying their structures, and their impact on anti-viruses. Our analysis reveals that most of the anti-viruses do not have a suitable architecture in place to detect decompression quines. Even worse, some of them are vulnerable to denial-of-service attacks exploiting quines. Motivated by our findings, we study several quine detectors and propose a new one that exploits the fact that quines and non-quine files do not share the same underlying structure. Our evaluation against different datasets shows that the detector incurs no performance overhead at the expense of a low false positive rate.|||||||

287|1062697|Wireless networks are built upon a shared medium that makes it easy for adversaries to launch jamming-style attacks. These attacks can be easily accomplished by an adversary emitting radio frequency signals that do not follow an underlying MAC protocol. Jamming attacks can severely interfere with the normal operation of wireless networks and, consequently, mechanisms are needed that can cope with jamming attacks. In this paper, we examine radio interference attacks from both sides of the issue: first, we study the problem of conducting radio interference attacks on wireless networks, and second we examine the critical issue of diagnosing the presence of jamming attacks. Specifically, we propose four different jamming attack models that can be used by an adversary to disable the operation of a wireless network, and evaluate their effectiveness in terms of how each method affects the ability of a wireless node to send and receive packets. We then discuss different measurements that serve as the basis for detecting a jamming attack, and explore scenarios where each measurement by itself is not enough to reliably classify the presence of a jamming attack. In particular, we observe that signal strength and carrier sensing time are unable to conclusively detect the presence of a jammer. Further, we observe that although by using packet delivery ratio we may differentiate between congested and jammed scenarios, we are nonetheless unable to conclude whether poor link utility is due to jamming or the mobility of nodes. The fact that no single measurement is sufficient for reliably classifying the presence of a jammer is an important observation, and necessitates the development of enhanced detection schemes that can remove ambiguity when detecting a jammer. To address this need, we propose two enhanced detection protocols that employ consistency checking. The first scheme employs signal strength measurements as a reactive consistency check for poor packet delivery ratios, while the second scheme employs location information to serve as the consistency check. Throughout our discussions, we examine the feasibility and effectiveness of jamming attacks and detection schemes using the MICA2 Mote platform.|||||||

Our approach, which we call randomize-and-link, uses large checksum cords to ""link"" message fragments in a way that is highly scalable, for the checksums serve both as associative addresses and data integrity verifiers. The main advantage of these checksum cords is that they spread the addresses of possible router messages across a spectrum that is too large for the attacker to easily create messages that collide with legitimate messages. Our methods therefore scale to attack trees containing hundreds of routers and do not require that a victim know the topology of the attack tree a priori.

Indeed, in one of our constructions, a bastion may consist merely of a publicly accessible random data source, rather than a special purpose server.

292|1402981|This paper presents the design and implementation of a filter-based DoS defense system (StopIt) and a comparison study on the effectiveness of filters and capabilities. Central to the StopIt design is a novel closed-control, open-service architecture: any receiver can use StopIt to block the undesired traffic it receives, yet the design is robust to various strategic attacks from millions of bots, including filter exhaustion attacks and bandwidth flooding attacks that aim to disrupt the timely installation of filters. Our evaluation shows that StopIt can block the attack traffic from a few millions of attackers within tens of minutes with bounded router memory. We compare StopIt with existing filter-based and capability-based DoS defense systems under simulated DoS attacks of various types and scales. Our results show that StopIt outperforms existing filter-based systems, and can prevent legitimate communications from being disrupted by various DoS flooding attacks. It also outperforms capability-based systems in most attack scenarios, but a capability-based system is more effective in a type of attack that the attack traffic does not reach a victim, but congests a link shared by the victim. These results suggest that both filters and capabilities are highly effective DoS defense mechanisms, but neither is more effective than the other in all types of DoS attacks.|||||||

297|1070878|"This paper focuses on ""router-based"" defense mechanisms, and whether they can provide effective solutions to network Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks. Router-based defenses operate either on traffic aggregates or on individual flows, and have been shown, either alone or in combination with other schemes, e.g., traceback, to be reasonably effective against certain types of basic attacks. Those attacks are, however, relatively brute-force, and usually accompanied by either significant increases in congestion, and/or traffic patterns that are easily identified. It is, therefore, unclear if router-based solutions are viable in the presence of more diverse or sophisticated attacks. As a result, even if incorporating defense mechanisms in the routers themselves has obvious advantages, such schemes have not seen wide deployments. Our ultimate goal is to determine whether it is possible to build router-based defense mechanisms that are effective against a wide range of attacks. This paper describes a first phase of this effort aimed at identifying weaknesses in existing systems. In particular, the paper demonstrates that aggregate defense systems can be readily circumvented, even by a single attacker, through minor modifications of its flooding patterns. Flow-based defenses fare slightly better, but can still be easily fooled by a small number of attackers generating transient flooding patterns. The findings of the paper provide insight into possible approaches for designing better and more robust router-based defense systems."|||||||

Using a combination of analytical modeling, simulations, and Internet experiments, we show that maliciously chosen low-rate DoS traffic patterns that exploit TCP's retransmission timeout mechanism can throttle TCP flows to a small fraction of their ideal rate while eluding detection. Moreover, as such attacks exploit protocol homogeneity, we study fundamental limits of the ability of a class of randomized timeout mechanisms to thwart such low-rate DoS attacks.|||||||

311|1455796|"This paper considers DoS attacks on DNS wherein attackers flood the nameservers of a zone to disrupt resolution of resource records belonging to the zone and consequently, any of its sub-zones. We propose a minor change in the caching behavior of DNS resolvers that can significantly alleviate the impact of such attacks. In our proposal, DNS resolvers do not completely evict cached resource records whose TTL has expired; rather, such resource records are stored in a separate ""stale cache"". If, during the resolution of a query, a resolver does not receive any response from the nameservers that are responsible for authoritatively answering the query, it can use the information stored in the stale cache to answer the query. In effect, the stale cache is the part of the global DNS database that has been accessed by the resolver and represents an insurance policy that the resolver uses only when the relevant DNS servers are unavailable. We analyze a 65-day DNS trace to quantify the benefits of a stale cache under different attack scenarios. Further, while the proposed change to DNS resolvers also changes DNS semantics, we argue that it does not adversely impact any of the fundamental DNS characteristics such as the autonomy of zone operators and hence, is a very simple and practical candidate for mitigating the impact of DoS attacks on DNS."|||||||

Considering the complicated design of the SS and its easily-accessible system services (e.g., via Android APIs), we conjecture that the SS may face DoS attacks. As the SS plays the important role in Android, serious DoS attacks could cause single-point-of-failure to the phone system. By studying the source code, we discovered a general design trait in the concurrency control mechanism of the SS that could be vulnerable to DoS attacks. To validate our hypothesis, we design a tool to cost efficiently explore high-risk methods in the SS. After a systematic analysis of 2,154 candidate-risky methods, we found four unknown vulnerabilities in critical services (e.g., the ActivityManager and the WindowManager), which are named the Android Stroke Vulnerabilities ({\it ASVs}). Exploiting the ASVs would continuously block all other requests for system services, followed by killing the SS and soft-rebooting the OS. Results of a further threat analysis show that by writing a loop to invoke Android APIs in an app, an attacker can continually freeze (reboot) the device at targeted critical moments (e.g., when patching vulnerable apps). Furthermore, ASVs can be exploited to enhance malware with anti-removal capability or to design the ransomware by putting the devices into continuous DoS loops. After being informed, Google confirmed our findings promptly. We also proposed to their Android framework team several improvements in their concurrency control design and a fine-grained failure recovery mechanism for the SS.|||||||

DNSSEC strengthens DNS by preventing attacks such as cache poisoning. However, a common argument against the deployment of DNSSEC is its potential for abuse in Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks, in particular reflection and amplification attacks. DNS responses for a DNSSEC-signed domain are typically larger than those for an unsigned domain, thus, it may seem that DNSSEC could actually worsen the problem of DNS-based DDoS attacks. The potential for abuse in DNSSEC-signed domains has, however, never been assessed on a large scale.|||||||
330|2905159|Denial of Service (DoS)/ DDoS attack is a common and severe problem for network security researchers and practitioners. Attackers often generate attack traffic that behaves similar to normal network traffic using sophisticated attacking tools. Many intrusion detection systems fail to detect anomalous packets in real time. In this paper, we use a Multivariate Correlation Analysis (MCA) approach to distinguish attack traffic from normal traffic. This statistical measure is used to analyze the behavior of network traffic for attack detection. Since DDoS attack traffic behaves differently from legitimate network traffic, statistical properties of various parameters reflect the changed behavior of network traffic. We extract three basic parameters of network traffic, viz., entropy of source IPs, variation of source IPs and packet rate to analyze the behavior of network traffic during attack detection. The method is validated using several benchmark datasets.|||||||
331|2800005|DDoS attacks have become fatal attacks in recent times. There are large number of incidents which have been reported recently and caused heavy downtime and economic losses. Evolution of utility computing models like cloud computing and its adoption across enterprises is visible due to many promising features. Effects of DDoS attacks in cloud are no more similar to what they were in traditional fixed or on premise infrastructure. In addition to effects on the service, economic or sustainability effects are significant in the form of Economic Denial of Sustainability (EDoS) attacks. We argue that in a multi-tenant public cloud, multiple stakeholders are involved other than the victim server. Some of these important stakeholders are co-hosted virtual servers, physical server(s), network and, cloud service providers. We have shown through system analysis, experiments and simulations that these stakeholders are indeed affected though they are not the actual targets. Effects to other stakeholders include performance interference, web service performance, resource race, indirect EDoS, downtime and, business losses. Cloud scale simulations have revealed that overall energy consumption and no. of VM migrations are adversely affected due to DDoS/EDoS attacks. Losses to these stakeholders should be properly accounted and there is a need to devise methods to isolate these components well.|||||||

336|1774234|Network capabilities have been proposed to prevent Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks proactively. A capability is a ticket-like token, checkable by routers, that a server can issue for legitimate traffic. Still, malicious hosts may swamp a server with requests for capability establishment, essentially causing possible Denial-of-Capability (DoC). In this paper, we propose an algorithm to mitigate DoC attacks. The algorithm divides the server's capacity for handling capability requests into quotas. Quotas are allocated based on a sink tree architecture. Randomization and Bloom filters are used as tools against threats (attacking scenarios). We both analytically and experimentally show that legitimate hosts can get service with guaranteed probability. We also address issues on fault-tolerance and the deployment of the approach proposed.|||||||
337|3242142|Recent work shows that an adversary can exploit a coupling effect induced by hidden nodes to launch a cascading attack causing global congestion in a Wi-Fi network. The underlying assumption is that the power of interference caused by a hidden node is an order of magnitude stronger than the signal sent to the receiver. In this paper, we investigate the feasibility of cascading attacks with weakly interfering hidden nodes, that is when the signal-to-interference ratio is high. Through extensive ns-3 simulations, including for an indoor building model, we show that cascading attacks are still feasible. The attacks leverage two PHY-layer phenomena: receiver capture and bit rate adaptation. We show that the attack relies on a coupling effect, whereby the average bit rate of a transmission pair drops sharply as the channel utilization of a neighboring pair gets higher. This coupling effect facilitates the propagation of the attack throughout the network.|||||||

339|633032|Denial of service (DoS) attacks continue to threaten the reliability of networking systems. Previous approaches for protecting networks from DoS attacks are reactive in that they wait for an attack to be launched before taking appropriate measures to protect the network. This leaves the door open for other attacks that use more sophisticated methods to mask their traffic.We propose an architecture called Secure Overlay Services (SOS) that proactively prevents DoS attacks, geared toward supporting Emergency Services or similar types of communication. The architecture is constructed using a combination of secure overlay tunneling, routing via consistent hashing, and filtering. We reduce the probability of successful attacks by (i) performing intensive filtering near protected network edges, pushing the attack point perimeter into the core of the network, where high-speed routers can handle the volume of attack traffic, and (ii) introducing randomness and anonymity into the architecture, making it difficult for an attacker to target nodes along the path to a specific SOS-protected destination.Using simple analytical models, we evaluate the likelihood that an attacker can successfully launch a DoS attack against an SOS-protected network. Our analysis demonstrates that such an architecture reduces the likelihood of a successful attack to minuscule levels.|||||||
340|3133155|A large amount of Distributed Reflective Denial-of-Service (DRDoS) attacks are launched every day, and our understanding of the modus operandi of their perpetrators is yet very limited as we are submerged with so Big Data to analyze and do not have reliable and complete ways to validate our findings. In this paper, we propose a first analytic pipeline that enables us to cluster and characterize attack campaigns into several main profiles that exhibit similarities. These similarities are due to common technical properties of the underlying infrastructures used to launch these attacks. Although we do not have access to the ground truth and we do not know how many perpetrators are acting behind the scene, we can group their attacks based on relevant commonalities with cluster ensembling to estimate their number and capture their profiles over time. Specifically, our results show that we can repeatably identify and group together common profiles of attacks while considering domain expert's constraint in the cluster ensembles. From the obtained consensus clusters, we can generate comprehensive rules that characterize past campaigns and that can be used for classifying the next ones despite the evolving nature of the attacks. Such rules can be further used to filter out garbage traffic in Internet Service Provider networks.|||||||
341|1102234|A typical wireless sensor node has little protection against radio jamming. The situation becomes worse if energy-efficient jamming can be achieved by exploiting knowledge of the data link layer. Encrypting the packets may help prevent the jammer from taking actions based on the content of the packets, but the temporal arrangement of the packets induced by the nature of the protocol might unravel patterns that the jammer can take advantage of even when the packets are encrypted. By looking at the packet interarrival times in three representative MAC protocols, S-MAC, LMAC and B-MAC, we derive several jamming attacks that allow the jammer to jam S-MAC, LMAC and B-MAC energy-efficiently. The jamming attacks are based on realistic assumptions. The algorithms are described in detail and simulated. The effectiveness and efficiency of the attacks are examined. Careful analysis of other protocols belonging to the respective categories of S-MAC, LMAC and B-MAC reveal that those protocols are, to some extent, also susceptible to our attacks. The result of this investigation provides new insights into the security considerations of MAC protocols.|||||||

345|2693632|Application layer (L7) Distributed Denial of Service attacks are becoming more common and an emerging threat to legitimate sites. The goal of these attacks is to prevent legitimate users from accessing a website. Due to the nature of the attacks, the low rate, and the sophisticated imitation of user behavior from automated bots, it is difficult to diagnose these on time. There is an evolving 'industry' of blackmailing and using these attacks for illegal profit [1]. Even though L7 DDoS attacks are a serious threat, studying and experimenting with them is challenging. Organizations do not share server logs because of privacy concerns. Furthermore, implementing these attacks requires instrumentation and real testbeds in order to produce realistic attacks for analysis. Therefore, it is difficult to evaluate mitigation and detection techniques. Our contribution is twofold. First, we have developed a set of testbeds on the GENI (Global Environment for Network Infrastructure) cloud infrastructure [2] to facilitate research and development of detection and mitigation techniques of L7 DDoS attacks. Second, we have used a library of attacks to perform post forensic analysis and classify L7 DDoS attacks based on their individual characteristics. Our work automates and simplifies log generation of L7 DDoS attacks for research and experimentation, as well as provides criteria to detect abnormal requests using a library of attacks.|||||||

The use of simulation permits assessment of overlays under network perturbations such as Denial of Service (DoS) attacks and flash crowds. Such conditions may occur frequently on the Internet but cannot be used for evaluation through observation of the Internet. We constructed QoS compliant overlays using QoSMap, an overlay construction scheme which constructs overlays for applications with strict QoS requirements. Using ns-2 based simulation; we launched DoS attack in the overlays and assessed their capability in meeting QoS requirements under severe network behavior. With 10 different network traffic conditions, network bursts and HTTP-delay traffic as traffic sources, five different overlay topologies, and latency and loss rate as QoS constraints, we noted that even under network attacks, QoSMap constructed overlays were able to meet applications requirements overlays of high QoS and long lifetime. This paper provides insight into the use of such simulation in general to study the effectiveness of overlay construction and other higher level applications to be resilient to destructive network perturbations.|||||||

349|511518|It is widely recognized that distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks can disrupt electronic commerce and cause large revenue losses. However, effective defenses continue to be mostly unavailable. We describe and evaluate VIPnet, a novel value-added network service for protecting e-commerce and other transaction-based sites from DDoS attacks. In VIPnet, e-merchants pay Internet Service Providers (ISPs) to carry the packets of the e-merchants' best clients (called VIPs) in a privileged class of service (CoS), protected from congestion, whether malicious or not, in the regular CoS. VIPnet rewards VIPs with not only better quality of service, but also greater availability. Because VIP rights are client- and server-specific, cannot be forged, are usage-limited, and are only replenished after successful client transactions (e.g., purchases), it is impractical for attackers to mount and sustain DDoS attacks against an e-merchant's VIPs. VIPnet can be deployed incrementally and does not require universal adoption. Experiments demonstrate VIPnet's benefits.|||||||

With 38.9% of market share, Android is now the most used operating system not just in terms of mobile devices but considering all OSes. As applications' complexity and features increased, Android relied more heavily on code and data sharing among apps for faster response times and richer user experience. To achieve that, Android apps reuse functionality and data by means of inter-app message passing where each app defines the messages it expects to receive. In this paper, we analyze the proliferation of exploitable inter-app communication vulnerabilities using a rich corpus of 1) a representative sample of 32 Android devices, 2) 59 official Google Android versions, and 3) the top 18,583 apps from 2016 to 2017. This corpus covers $91$ Android builds from version 4.4 to present. To the best of our knowledge, ours is the first longitudinal study looking into the propagation of vulnerabilities across AOSP builds, between AOSP and a diverse set of devices, and across app versions over a period of 13 months. To identify inter-app vulnerabilities, we developed Daze as a swift and fully-automated framework for extracting app components and fuzzing all app interfaces. Daze needs only about three hours for full-device analysis or two minutes per app on average. We identified 14,413 vulnerabilities and quantified their exposure time and the number of versions affected. Our findings revealed that $51.7%$ of Android devices and $49%$ of the top $300$ apps on Google Play contained at least one critical inter-app vulnerability. We found that about $15%$ of fixed vulnerabilities lived for more than $100$ days before being patched, more than $20%$ of unpatched vulnerabilities have existed for at least $180$ days, and $45%$ of unpatched vulnerabilities persisted through the latest two to four consecutive app versions in our dataset.|||||||

391|1980086|Denial of Service (DoS henceforth) attack is performed solely with the intention to deny the legitimate users to access services. Since DoS attack is usually performed by means of bots, automated software. These bots send a large number of fake requests to the server which exceeds server buffer capacity which results in DoS attack. In this paper we propose an idea to prevent DoS attack on web-sites which ask for user credentials before it allows them to access resources. Our approach is based on CAPTCHA verification. We verify CAPTCHA submitted by user before allowing the access to credentials page. The CAPTCHA would consist of variety of patterns that would be distinct in nature and are randomly generated during each visit to the webpage. Most of the current web sites use a common methodology to generate all its CAPTCHAs. The bots usually take advantage of this approach since bots are able to decipher those CAPTCHAs. A set of distinct CAPTCHA patterns prevents bots to decipher it and consequently helps to reduce the generation of illicit traffic. This preserves the server bandwidth to allow the legitimate users to access the site.|||||||

405|3241052|The MAC standard amendment IEEE 802.15.4e is designed to meet the requirements of industrial and critical applications. In particular, the Time Slotted Channel Hopping (TSCH) mode divides time into periodic, equally sized, slotframes composed of transmission timeslots. Then, it combines time slotted access with multichannel and channel hopping capabilities, providing large network capacity, high reliability, and predictable latency while ensuring energy efficiency. Since every network node considers the same timeslots at each slotframe and selects physical channels according to a periodic function, TSCH produces a steady channel utilization pattern. This can be exploited by a selective jammer to entirely thwart communications of a victim node in a way that is stealthy, effective, and extremely energy efficient. This article shows how a selective jamming attack can be successfully performed even though TSCH uses the IEEE 802.15.4e security services. Furthermore, we propose DISH, a countermeasure which randomly permutes the timeslot and channel utilization patterns at every slotframe in a consistent and completely distributed way without requiring any additional message exchange. We have implemented DISH for the Contiki OS and tested its effectiveness on TelosB sensor nodes. Quantitative analysis for different network configurations shows that DISH effectively contrasts selective jamming with negligible performance penalty.|||||||
406|3234852|"Battery-powered and energy-harvesting IEEE 802.15.4 nodes are subject to so-called denial-of-sleep attacks. Such attacks generally aim at draining the energy of a victim device. Especially, session key establishment schemes for IEEE 802.15.4 security are susceptible to denial-of-sleep attacks since injected requests for session key establishment typically trigger energy-consuming processing and communication. Nevertheless, Krentz et al.'s Adaptive Key Establishment Scheme (AKES) for IEEE 802.15.4 security is deemed to be resilient to denial-of-sleep attacks thanks to its energy-efficient design and special defenses. However, thus far, AKES' resilience to denial-of-sleep attacks was presumably never evaluated. In this paper, we make two contributions. First, we evaluate AKES' resilience to denial-of-sleep attacks both theoretically and empirically. We particularly consider two kinds of denial-of-sleep attacks, namely HELLO flood attacks, as well as what we introduce in this paper as ""yo-yo attacks"". Our key finding is that AKES' denial-of-sleep defenses require trade-offs between denial-of-sleep resilience and the speed at which AKES adapts to topology changes. Second, to alleviate these trade-offs, we devise and evaluate new denial-of-sleep defenses. Indeed, our newly-devised denial-of-sleep defenses turn out to significantly accelerate AKES' reaction to topology changes, without incurring much overhead nor sacrificing on security."|||||||

410|3055382|With the exponential growth of automotive security research, new security vulnerabilities and attacks have been revealed and new challenges have emerged. In recent years, various attacks ranging from replay attacks, through false information injection, to Denial of Service (DoS), have shown how fragile automotive security is. As a result, a number of security solutions have been proposed that rely on techniques like encryption and firewalls. However, most proposals require performance and computational overheads that would become an additional burden rather than a solution. In this paper, we propose a new automotive network algorithm, called ID-Hopping, that aims to prevent targeted DoS attacks in which attackers target certain functions by injecting special frames that would prevent a car's normal operations. We aim to raise the bar for attackers by randomizing the expected patterns in the automotive network. Such randomization hinders the attacker's ability to launch targeted DoS attacks. We built a testing platform and implemented the randomization mechanism to evaluate the algorithm's effectiveness. Based on the evaluation, the algorithm holds a promising solution for targeted DoS, and even reverse engineering, which automotive networks are most vulnerable to.|||||||
411|2978335|Large numbers of smart connected devices, also named as the Internet of Things (IoT), are permeating our environments (homes, factories, cars, and also our body - with wearable devices) to collect data and act on the insight derived. Ensuring software integrity (including OS, apps, and configurations) on such smart devices is then essential to guarantee both privacy and safety. A key mechanism to protect the software integrity of these devices is remote attestation: A process that allows a remote verifier to validate the integrity of the software of a device. This process usually makes use of a signed hash value of the actual device's software, generated by dedicated hardware. While individual device attestation is a well-established technique, to date integrity verification of a very large number of devices remains an open problem, due to scalability issues. In this paper, we present SANA, the first secure and scalable protocol for efficient attestation of large sets of devices that works under realistic assumptions. SANA relies on a novel signature scheme to allow anyone to publicly verify a collective attestation in constant time and space, for virtually an unlimited number of devices. We substantially improve existing swarm attestation schemes by supporting a realistic trust model where: (1) only the targeted devices are required to implement attestation; (2) compromising any device does not harm others; and (3) all aggregators can be untrusted. We implemented SANA and demonstrated its efficiency on tiny sensor devices. Furthermore, we simulated SANA at large scale, to assess its scalability. Our results show that SANA can provide efficient attestation of networks of 1,000,000 devices, in only 2.5 seconds.|||||||

We study the properties of both types of events with a special attention to characteristics that distinguish the two. Identifying these characteristics allows a formulation of a strategy for Web sites to quickly discard malicious requests. We also show that some content distribution networks (CDNs) may not provide the desired level of protection to Web sites against flash events. We therefore propose an enhancement to CDNs that offers better protection and use trace-driven simulations to study the effect of our enhancement on CDNs and Web sites.|||||||

417|1241834|Current intrusion detection and prevention systems seek to detect a wide class of network intrusions (e.g., DoS attacks, worms, port scans) at network vantage points. Unfortunately, even today, many IDS systems we know of keep per-connection or per-flow state to detect malicious TCP flows. Thus, it is hardly surprising that these IDS systems have not scaled to multigigabit speeds. By contrast, both router lookups and fair queuing have scaled to high speeds using aggregation via prefix lookups or DiffServ. Thus, in this paper, we initiate research into the question as to whether one can detect attacks without keeping per-flow state. We will show that such aggregation, while making fast implementations possible, immediately causes two problems. First, aggregation can cause behavioral aliasing where, for example, good behaviors can aggregate to look like bad behaviors. Second, aggregated schemes are susceptible to spoofing by which the intruder sends attacks that have appropriate aggregate behavior. We examine a wide variety of DoS and scanning attacks and show that several categories (bandwidth based, claim-and-hold, port-scanning) can be scalably detected. In addition to existing approaches for scalable attack detection, we propose a novel data structure called partial completion filters (PCFs) that can detect claim-and-hold attacks scalably in the network. We analyze PCFs both analytically and using experiments on real network traces to demonstrate how we can tune PCFs to achieve extremely low false positive and false negative probabilities.|||||||

In September of 2016, Mirai software was used to infect more than 100,000 devices and unleash one of the largest distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks up to that time. After this incident, many people identified multiple large attacks coming from Internet of Things (IoT) devices, like CCTV cameras, and described these attacks as a new trend. A technique to detect whether a signal source is counterfeited in the initial stage of a DDoS attack is important. This paper proposes a method for the quick detection of a spoofed Internet protocol (IP) during a DDoS attack based on a DDoS shelter that is established to defend against DDoS attacks. In order to achieve this goal, we evaluate the number of time-to-live hops in normal traffic as a reference for the bandwidth of each network that is accessible to the DDoS shelter. In this study, we conduct an experiment using cases of actual DDoS attacks. As a result of this experiment, we prove that our proposed method quickly detects a spoofed IP.|||||||

Nevertheless, mutual authentication is not ensured in Lin et al.'s protocol such that it suffers from the server spoofing attack. Moreover, Lin et al.'s protocol is also vulnerable to the denial-of-service attack. As a result, we present a secure strong-password authentication protocol in this paper to overcome their disadvantages.|||||||
426|1378214|With today's penetration in volume and variety of information flowing across the Internet, data and services are experiencing various issues with the TCP/IP infrastructure, most notably availability, reliability and mobility. Therefore, a critical infrastructure is highly desireable, in particular for multimedia streaming applications. So far the proposed approaches have focused on applying application-layer routing and path monitoring for reliability and on enforcing stateful packet filters in hosts or network to protect against Denial of Service (DoS) attacks. Each of them solves its own aspect of the problem, trading scalability for availability and reliability among a relatively small set of nodes, yet there is no single overall solution available which addresses these issues in a large scale.|||||||
427|1806587|Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP) is a widely adopted standard for transmission of multimedia traffic in Internet telephony (commonly known as VoIP). Therefore, it is a hot potential target for imposters who can launch different types of Denial of Service (DoS) attacks to disrupt communication; resulting in not only substantive revenue loss to VoIP operators but also undermining the reliability of VoIP infrastructure. The major contribution of this paper is an online framework -- RTP-Miner -- that detects RTP fuzzing attacks in realtime; as a result, it is not possible to deny access to legitimate users. RTP-Miner can detect both header and payload fuzzing attacks. Fuzzing in the header of RTP packets is detected by combining well known distance measures with a decision tree based classifier. In comparison, payload fuzzing is detected through a novel Markov state space model at the receiver. We evaluate RTP-Miner on a realworld RTP traffic dataset. The results show that RTP-Miner detects fuzzing in RTP header with more than 98% accuracy and less than 0.1% false alarm rate even when only 3% fuzzing is introduced. For the same fuzzing rate, it detects payload fuzzing -- a significantly more challenging problem -- with more than 80% accuracy and less than 2% false alarm rate. RTP-Miner has low memory and processing overheads that makes it well suited for deployment in real world VoIP infrastructure.|||||||

429|3220128|Many countries have set up E-health monitoring systems to relieve the pressure on care service with continuous monitoring services. Wireless software-defined-network (SDN) enabled massive machine-type communications (mMTC) network architecture is agreed as a promising candidate to support feasible management on wireless monitoring devices in E-health system. The existing anomaly detection scheme (ADS) in SDN-mMTC involves periodically traffic uploading for monitoring and model re-training, leading to big scalability issues in E-health system. Therefore, this paper proposes a Localized Evolving Semi-supervised Learning Based Anomaly detection scheme (LESLA), which employs the idea of offline training plus online testing to allow running localized ADS to be feasible on wireless mMTC devices. Besides, LESLA adopts semi-supervised learning together with contrastive pessimistic likelihood estimation (CPLE) to enable the self-evolving during anomaly detection. Such design results in promising good performance even in the case of outlier or infrequent model renewal. Furthermore, CPLE_LESLA scheme is proposed to further improve the performance of LESLA. The theoretical analysis and the simulation are carried out to demonstrate the efficiency and advantages of LESLA scheme in mMTC.|||||||
430|3212488|Wake-up radios are mechanisms that control the sleep and active modes of energy-constrained Internet of Things (IoT) nodes. These radios detect pre-determined wake-up tokens and switch the devices to an active state. Such systems are vulnerable to a kind of Denial-of-Service attacks called Denial-of-Sleep, where attackers continuously send wake-up tokens to deplete the battery of the nodes. We propose a protocol to mitigate these attacks that includes a novel solution to generate hard-to-guess wake-up tokens at every wake-up. Simulations show that under standard operating conditions, it has a negligible energy overhead (0.03%), while it increases the lifetime of an IoT node by more than 40 times under Denial-of-Sleep attack. Finally we compare our protocol to related work against Denial-of-Sleep attacks, and explain why it is both more resilient and more energy-efficient than existing approaches.|||||||

With the increasing ubiquity of personal computing handheld devices, such as mobile phones and PDAs, together with deployment of sensor networks, experience shows that over the last few years attacker who are specializing in disrupting and hijacking these wireless peripheral devices are gaining widespread access to potentially lucrative corporate and government information. Several of these tools have probably been used increasingly as part of hostile behavior either independently, or in conjunction with other forms of attack in conventional or asymmetric warfare, as well as in other forms of malicious behavior. In this paper we concentrate on Distributed Denial of Service Attacks (DDoS) detections by applying sensor nodes where one or more attackers generate flooding traffics and direct it from multiple sources towards a selected node. The dynamic and wide range of connectivity in between states (Busy, Idle, Suspend and Off) provides means of determining thresholds of normal resource usability and activities in each state within sensor nodes. We then present a technique that can be used for DDoS detection based on resource usability of sensor nodes. We measure resource dissipation in different nodes, make comparison and evaluate their resource usability. We use Hawk sensor nodes to do experiment on our test-bed to show the positive outcomes that DDoS attack on sensor nodes can be detected from the resource usability.|||||||

The solution is evaluated through a number of experiments based on actual Internet data. The results show that the proposed solution achieves a high throughput of surviving legitimate traffic as a result of its high convergence speed, and can save the victim's bandwidth even in case of varying and intense attacks.|||||||

So, the need of source-based defense mechanism against such attacks is pressing. In this paper, we mainly focus on the source-based defense mechanism against Botnet-based DDoS flooding attack through combining the power of Software-Defined Networking (SDN) and sample flow (sFlow) technology. Firstly, we defined a metric to measure the essential features of this kind attack which means distribution and collaboration. Then we designed a simple detection algorithm based on statistical inference model and response scheme through the abilities of SDN. Finally, we developed an application to realize our idea and also tested its effect on emulation network with real network traffic. The result shows that our mechanism could effectively detect DDoS flooding attack originated in SDN environment and identify attack flows for avoiding the harm of attack spreading to target or outside. We advocate the advantages of SDN in the area of defending DDoS attacks, because it is difficult and laborious to organize selfish and undisciplined traditional distributed network to confront well collaborative DDoS flooding attacks.|||||||

Software-defined networking (SDN) is an emerging technology for computer networks that uses open protocols for controlling switches and routers placed at the network edges by using specialized open programmable interfaces. In this article, a detailed study on DDoS threats prevalent in SDN is presented. First, SDN features are examined from the perspective of security, and then a discussion on SDN security features is done. Further, two viewpoints on protecting networks against DDoS attacks are presented. In the first view, SDN utilizes its abilities to secure conventional networks. In the second view, SDN may become a victim of the threat itself because of the centralized control mechanism. The main focus of this research work is on discovering critical security implications in SDN while reviewing the current ongoing research studies. By emphasizing the available state-of-the-art techniques, an extensive review of the advancement of SDN security is provided to the research and IT communities.|||||||

Network security plays important role of protecting information, hardware and software on a computer network. Denial of service (DOS) attacks causes great impacts on the internet world. These attacks attempt to disrupt legitimate user's access to services. By exploiting computer's vulnerabilities, attackers easily consume victim's resources. Many special techniques have been developed to protest against DOS attacks. Some organizations constitute several defense mechanism tools to tackle the security problems. This paper has proposed various types of attacks and solutions associated with each layers of OSI model. These attacks and solutions have different impacts on the different environment. Thus the rapid growth of new technologies may constitute still worse impacts of attacks in the future.|||||||
442|948113|Since IP packet reassembly requires resources, a denial of service attack can be mounted by swamping a receiver with IP fragments. In this paper we argue how this attack need not affect protocols that do not rely on IP fragmentation, and argue how most protocols, e.g., those that run on top of TCP, can avoid the need for fragmentation. However, protocols such as IPsec's IKE protocol, which both runs on top of UDP and requires sending large packets, depend on IP packet reassembly. Photuris, an early proposal for IKE, introduced the concept of a stateless cookie, intended for DoS protection. However, the stateless cookie mechanism cannot protect against a DoS attack unless the receiver can successfully receive the cookie, which it will not be able to do if reassembly resources are exhausted. Thus, without additional design and/or implementation defenses, an attacker can successfully, through a fragmentation attack, prevent legitimate IKE handshakes from completing. Defense against this attack requires both protocol design and implementation defenses. The IKEv2 protocol was designed to make it easy to design a defensive implementation. This paper explains the defense strategy designed into the IKEv2 protocol, along with the additional needed implementation mechanisms. It also describes and contrasts several other potential strategies that could work for similar UDP-based protocols.|||||||
443|1618583|In a bandwidth-flooding attack, compromised sources send high-volume traffic to the target with the purpose of causing congestion in its tail circuit and disrupting its legitimate communications. In this paper, we present Active Internet Traffic Filtering (AITF), a network-layer defense mechanism against such attacks. AITF enables a receiver to contact misbehaving sources and ask them to stop sending it traffic; each source that has been asked to stop is policed by its own Internet service provider (ISP), which ensures its compliance. An ISP that hosts misbehaving sources either supports AITF (and accepts to police its misbehaving clients), or risks losing all access to the complaining receiver--this is a strong incentive to cooperate, especially when the receiver is a popular public-access site. We show that AITF preserves a significant fraction of a receiver's bandwidth in the face of bandwidth flooding, and does so at a per-client cost that is already affordable for today's ISPs; this per-client cost is not expected to increase, as long as botnet-size growth does not outpace Moore's law. We also show that even the first two networks that deploy AITF can maintain their connectivity to each other in the face of bandwidth flooding. We conclude that the network-layer of the Internet can provide an effective, scalable, and incrementally deployable solution against bandwidth-flooding attacks.|||||||

The architecture allows multiple cooperating DDoS mitigation techniques to classify incoming network packets. The proposed architecture consists of two separate partitions static and dynamic. The static partition includes packet pre-processing and post-processing modules while the DDoS filtering techniques are implemented within the dynamic partition. These filtering techniques can be implemented by either hardware custom computing cores or general purpose soft processors or both. In all cases, these DDoS filtering computing cores can be updated or changed at runtime or design time.

By leveraging an emerging network architecture based on edge computers, IoT's availability can be protected even under situations such as network failures or denial-of-service (DoS) attacks. However, little has been explored for the issue of sustaining availability even when edge computers fail.

Specifically, we point out necessary considerations for planning secure migration and present automated migration policy construction and protocols for preparing and executing the migration. The effectiveness of our approach is illustrated using a concrete application of smart buildings and network simulation, where our proposed solution achieves significantly higher availability in case of failures in some of the authorization entities.|||||||

Despite their specialized nature as well as limited resources and connectivity, these devices are becoming an increasingly popular and attractive target for remote malware infestation attacks, exemplified by Stuxnet [1]. Many mitigation techniques have been proposed, varying in terms of generality and underlying assumptions. One common theme is the need for Remote Attestation, a distinct security service that allows a trusted party (verifier) to check the internal state of a remote untrusted embedded device (prover). Purely software-based techniques, while efficient, offer dubious security guarantees. Most hardware-based techniques are too costly for low-end embedded devices.This talk focuses on three important challenges in designing Remote Attestation techniques for low-end embedded devices. First, what is the minimal set of hardware and software features for a low-end embedded device to attain provably secure remote attestation, under the strongest possible and realistic adversary model? Second, what mechanisms and features are needed to protect the remote attestation process from unauthorized invocation, i.e., how to assure that an embedded device is not being misused? Third, how to design efficient remote attestation for a multitude of potentially heterogeneous embedded devices, e.g., within a vehicle, a household, or an aircraft?

458|2185460|In a multi-hop wireless ad hoc network, packet losses are attributed to harsh channel conditions and intentional packet discard by malicious nodes. In this paper, while observing a sequence of packet losses, we are interested in determining whether losses are due to link errors only, or due to the combined effect of link errors and malicious drop. We are especially interested in insider's attacks, whereby a malicious node that is part of the route exploits its knowledge of the communication context to selectively drop a small number of packets that are critical to network performance. Because the packet dropping rate in this case is comparable to the channel error rate, conventional algorithms that are based on detecting the packet loss rate cannot achieve satisfactory detection accuracy. To improve the detection accuracy, we propose to exploit the correlations between lost packets. Furthermore, to ensure truthful calculation of these correlations, we develop a homomorphic linear authenticator (HLA) based public auditing architecture that allows the detector to verify the truthfulness of the packet loss information reported by nodes. This architecture is privacy preserving, collusion proof, and incurs low communication and storage overheads. Through extensive simulations, we verify that the proposed mechanism achieves significantly better detection accuracy than conventional methods such as a maximum-likelihood based detection.|||||||
459|3317686|Energy is required for networking and computation and is a valuable resource for unplugged systems such as mobile, sensor, and embedded systems. Energy denial-of-service (DoS) attack where a remote attacker exhausts the victim’s battery via networking remains a critical challenge for the device availability. While prior literature proposes mitigation- and detection-based solutions, we propose to eliminate the vulnerability entirely by offloading the power requirements to the entity who makes the networking requests. To do so, we build communication channels using wireless charging signals (as opposed to the traditional radio-frequency signals), so that the communication and the power transfer are simultaneous and inseparable, and use the channels to build power-positive networking (PPN). PPN also offloads the computation-based costs to the requester, enabling authentication and other tasks considered too power-hungry for battery-operated devices. In this article, we study the energy DoS attack impacts on off-the-shelf embedded system platforms (Raspberry Pi and the ESP 8266 system-on-chip (SoC) module), present PPN, implement and build a Qi-charging-technology-compatible prototype, and use the prototype for evaluations and analyses.

467|1514018|Tracing attack packets to their sources, known as IP traceback, is an important step to counter distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks. In this paper, we propose a novel packet logging based (i.e., hash-based) traceback scheme that requires an order of magnitude smaller processing and storage cost than the hash-based scheme proposed by Snoeren et al. [1], thereby being able to scalable to much higher link speed (e.g., OC-768). The base-line idea of our approach is to sample and log a small percentage (e.g., 3.3%) of packets. The challenge of this low sampling rate is that much more sophisticated techniques need to be used for traceback. Our solution is to construct the attack tree using the correlation between the attack packets sampled by neighboring routers. The scheme using naive independent random sampling does not perform well due to the low correlation between the packets sampled by neighboring routers. We invent a sampling scheme that improves this correlation and the overall efficiency significantly. Another major contribution of this work is that we introduce a novel information-theoretic framework for our traceback scheme to answer important questions on system parameter tuning and the fundamental tradeoff between the resource used for traceback and the traceback accuracy. Simulation results based on real-world network topologies (e.g., Skitter) match very well with results from the information-theoretic analysis. The simulation results also demonstrate that our traceback scheme can achieve high accuracy, and scale very well to a large number of attackers (e.g., 5000+).|||||||

469|2808437|In this paper, we propose an innovative type of CAPTCHA (Completely Automated Public Turing test to tell Computers and Humans Apart). These tests are used to allow a service to discriminate human users from (malicious) bots. With FATCHA, the user is simply asked to perform at random some trivial gesture, e.g., moving the head, which will be captured by the computer webcam and recognized by the server hosting the service. A second module in a possible composite service allows the user to authenticate by face recognition instead of using a password. In this way we significantly exploit the potentiality of multimodal interaction for both an advanced Human Interactive Proof (HIP) test and for robust/comfortable authentication.|||||||
470|1298292|Denial of service attacks, viruses and worms are common tools for malicious adversarial behavior in networks. With the increasing ubiquity of personal computing handheld devices, such as mobile phones and PDAs, together with deployment of sensor networks, experience shows that over the last few years attacker who are specializing in disrupting and hijacking these wireless peripheral devices are gaining widespread access to potentially lucrative corporate and government information. Several of these tools have probably been used increasingly as part of hostile behavior either independently, or in conjunction with other forms of attack in conventional or asymmetric warfare, as well as in other forms of malicious behavior. In this paper we concentrate on Distributed Denial of Service Attacks (DDoS) detections by applying sensor nodes where one or more attackers generate flooding traffics and direct it from multiple sources towards a selected node. The dynamic and wide range of connectivity in between states (Busy, Idle, Suspend and Off) provides means of determining thresholds of normal resource usability and activities in each state within sensor nodes. We then present a technique that can be used for DDoS detection based on resource usability of sensor nodes. We measure resource dissipation in different nodes, make comparison and evaluate their resource usability. We use Hawk sensor nodes to do experiment on our test-bed to show the positive outcomes that DDoS attack on sensor nodes can be detected from the resource usability.|||||||

In this paper, we first analyze the role of SIP based floods in the Denial of Service (DoS) attacks on the IMS. Afterwards, we present an online intrusion detection framework for detection of such attacks. We analyze the role of different evolutionary and non-evolutionary classifiers on the classification accuracy of the proposed framework. We have evaluated the performance of our intrusion detection framework on a traffic in which SIP floods of varying intensities are injected. The results of our study show that the evolutionary classifiers like sUpervised Classifier System (UCS) and Genetic clASSIfier sySTem (GAssist) can even detect low intensity SIP floods in realtime. Finally, we formulate a set of specific guidelines that can help VoIP service providers in customizing our intrusion detection framework by selecting an appropriate classifier-depending on their requirements in different service scenarios.|||||||
473|3230844|This paper proposes a new adaptively distributed packet filtering mechanism to mitigate the DDoS attacks targeted at the victim's bandwidth. The mechanism employs IP traceback as a means of distinguishing attacks from legitimate traffic, and continuous action reinforcement learning automata, with an improved learning function, to compute effective filtering probabilities at filtering routers. The solution is evaluated through a number of experiments based on actual Internet data. The results show that the proposed solution achieves a high throughput of surviving legitimate traffic as a result of its high convergence speed, and can save the victim's bandwidth even in case of varying and intense attacks.|||||||

So, the need of source-based defense mechanism against such attacks is pressing. In this paper, we mainly focus on the source-based defense mechanism against Botnet-based DDoS flooding attack through combining the power of Software-Defined Networking (SDN) and sample flow (sFlow) technology. Firstly, we defined a metric to measure the essential features of this kind attack which means distribution and collaboration. Then we designed a simple detection algorithm based on statistical inference model and response scheme through the abilities of SDN. Finally, we developed an application to realize our idea and also tested its effect on emulation network with real network traffic. The result shows that our mechanism could effectively detect DDoS flooding attack originated in SDN environment and identify attack flows for avoiding the harm of attack spreading to target or outside. We advocate the advantages of SDN in the area of defending DDoS attacks, because it is difficult and laborious to organize selfish and undisciplined traditional distributed network to confront well collaborative DDoS flooding attacks.|||||||
477|3301614|Distributed Denial of Service attack (DDoS) is recognized to be one of the most catastrophic attacks against various digital communication entities. Software-defined networking (SDN) is an emerging technology for computer networks that uses open protocols for controlling switches and routers placed at the network edges by using specialized open programmable interfaces. In this article, a detailed study on DDoS threats prevalent in SDN is presented. First, SDN features are examined from the perspective of security, and then a discussion on SDN security features is done. Further, two viewpoints on protecting networks against DDoS attacks are presented. In the first view, SDN utilizes its abilities to secure conventional networks. In the second view, SDN may become a victim of the threat itself because of the centralized control mechanism. The main focus of this research work is on discovering critical security implications in SDN while reviewing the current ongoing research studies. By emphasizing the available state-of-the-art techniques, an extensive review of the advancement of SDN security is provided to the research and IT communities.|||||||

488|2818047|Botnets are one of the primary threats in computer security today. They are used for launching denial of service attacks, sending spam and phishing emails, and collecting private information. However, every botnet requires coordination. In order to initiate an attack, a botmaster must communicate to all of the bots in the network. In this paper, we present a steganographic system that demonstrates the feasibility of the social networking website Twitter as a botnet command and control center that an attacker could use to reliably communicate messages to a botnet with low latency and nearly perfect rate of transmission. Our system generates plausible cover messages based on a required tweet length determined by an encoding map that has been constructed based on the structure of the secret messages. The system considers both the input symbol frequencies (e.g. English letter frequencies) as well as the tweet length posting frequencies for constructing the encoding maps. A technique for automatically generating Twitter account names based on Markov chains is also presented so that the bots can connect to new accounts if the existing botmaster account is unavailable. All the experiments were performed using the 7.3M actual tweets from 3.7K verified accounts collected by the tweet parser developed by us. We have evaluated the efficacy of the system using Emulab and usability of the system through Amazon's Mechanical Turk with promising results. An analysis of the steganographic security of the proposed system has also been provided.

492|2042964|This paper develops parametric methods to detect network anomalies using only aggregate traffic statistics, in contrast to other works requiring flow separation, even when the anomaly is a small fraction of the total traffic. By adopting simple statistical models for anomalous and background traffic in the time domain, one can estimate model parameters in real time, thus obviating the need for a long training phase or manual parameter tuning. The proposed bivariate parametric detection mechanism (bPDM) uses a sequential probability ratio test, allowing for control over the false positive rate while examining the tradeoff between detection time and the strength of an anomaly. Additionally, it uses both traffic-rate and packet-size statistics, yielding a bivariate model that eliminates most false positives. The method is analyzed using the bit-rate signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) metric, which is shown to be an effective metric for anomaly detection. The performance of the bPDM is evaluated in three ways. First, synthetically generated traffic provides for a controlled comparison of detection time as a function of the anomalous level of traffic. Second, the approach is shown to be able to detect controlled artificial attacks over the University of Southern California (USC), Los Angeles, campus network in varying real traffic mixes. Third, the proposed algorithm achieves rapid detection of real denial-of-service attacks as determined by the replay of previously captured network traces. The method developed in this paper is able to detect all attacks in these scenarios in a few seconds or less.|||||||

This paper establishes essential design specifications for employing ZPD techniques in IMDs, offers a critical review of ZPD techniques found in literature and, subsequently, gives crucial recommendations for developing comprehensive ZPD solutions.|||||||
516|3040998|SDN provides a way to manage complex networks by introducing programmability and abstraction of the control plane. All networks suffer from attacks to critical infrastructure and services such as DDoS attacks. We make use of the programmability provided by the SDN environment to provide a game theoretic attack analysis and countermeasure selection model in this research work. The model is based on reward and punishment in a dynamic game with multiple players. The network bandwidth of attackers is downgraded for a certain period of time, and restored to normal when the player resumes cooperation. The presented solution is based on Nash Folk Theorem, which is used to implement a punishment mechanism for attackers who are part of DDoS traffic, and reward for players who cooperate, in effect enforcing desired outcome for the network administrator.|||||||
517|2554714|In this work, we propose a modified DEFENSE architecture termed as xDEFENSE that can detect and react to hardware attacks in real-time. In the past, several Root of Trust architectures such as DEFENSE and RETC have been proposed to foil attempts by hardware Trojans to leak sensitive information. In a typical Root of Trust architecture scenario, hardware is allowed to access the memory only by responding properly to a challenge requested by the memory guard. However in a recent effort, we observed that these architectures can in fact be susceptible to a variety of threats ranging from denial of service attacks, privilege escalation to information leakage, by injecting a Trojan into the Root of Trust modules such as memory guards and authorized hardware. In our work, we propose a security monitor that monitors all transactions between the authorized hardware, memory guard and memory. It also authenticates these components through the use of Hashed Message Authentication Codes (HMAC) to detect any invalid memory access or denial of service attack by disrupting the challenge-response pairs. The proposed xDEFENSE architecture was implemented on a Xilinx SPARTAN 3 FPGA evaluation board and our results indicate that xDEFENSE requires 143 additional slices as compared to DEFENSE and incurs a monitoring latency of 22ns.|||||||
518|2507927|Vehicular ad hoc network (VANET) is currently researched and achieved by several organizers to develop the intelligent transportation system (ITS). Research on Vehicular Ad hoc Network (VANET) has been conducting for long time. Nowadays, several organizers has obtained remarkable achievements contributing to the development of the Intelligent transportation system, ITS. The communication protocol in VANET named 802.11p protocol, has been improved to adapt to the high-speed environment. However, the communication among vehicles can be interfered even by Denial of Service (DoS) attacks such as jamming attacks. The vehicles communicate with each other in the high-speed environment. The time of data exchange between them must be extremely short. Solutions for detection of jamming attacks must occur quickly to detect more precisely. In order to detect jamming attacks more precisely, solutions therefore must occur very fast. In this paper, we propose one solution to detect jamming attacks. The following solution is based on the combination of the packet delivery ratio and its diminution.|||||||

520|2992861|A digital microfluidic biochip (DMFB) is an emerging technology that enables miniaturized analysis systems for point-of-care clinical diagnostics, DNA sequencing, and environmental monitoring. A DMFB reduces the rate of sample and reagent consumption, and automates the analysis of assays. In this paper, we provide the first assessment of the security vulnerabilities of DMFBs. We identify result-manipulation attacks on a DMFB that maliciously alter the assay outcomes. Two practical result-manipulation attacks are shown on a DMFB platform performing enzymatic glucose assay on serum. In the first attack, the attacker adjusts the concentration of the glucose sample and thereby modifies the final result. In the second attack, the attacker tampers with the calibration curve of the assay operation. We then identify denial-of-service attacks, where the attacker can disrupt the assay operation by tampering either with the droplet-routing algorithm or with the actuation sequence. We demonstrate these attacks using a digital microfluidic synthesis simulator. The results show that the attacks are easy to implement and hard to detect. Therefore, this work highlights the need for effective protections against malicious modifications in DMFBs.|||||||
521|2107587|Wireless sensor networks are highly prone to security threats due to resource constraints and the broadcast nature of the transmission medium. Directed diffusion protocol is one of the routing protocols for wireless sensor networks that are not designed with security in mind and are particularly susceptible to different security attacks. In this paper, a secure routing protocol for wireless sensor networks, based on the directed diffusion routing algorithm, is presented. The proposed secure routing protocol uses the μTESLA (micro Timed, Efficient, Streaming, Loss-tolerant Authentication) broadcasting authentication algorithm in order to authenticate the acknowledgement messages sent from the sink to the source nodes for confirming the delivery of the data-event messages. A simulation based performance evaluation for the proposed protocol was conducted against black hole and acknowledgement-spoofing attacks. Simulations show that, compared to the original directed diffusion protocol, the proposed secure routing protocol achieved better event-delivery and event-dropping ratios. However, it resulted higher cost in the mean dissipated energy and average delay in some situations due to acknowledgement and authentication processes for delivered events and also due to the retransmissions of non-acknowledged events.|||||||

To meet these needs and assure quality assurance, thorough wireless security testing needs to be completed before new products or services are released. Meticulous testing is expensive, consuming resources and time. This paper presents a general method for network security analysis and experimentation that reduces time and costs. Factorial experiment design tests multiple factors in parallel, while producing robust, repeatable and statistically significant results by treating all other parameters as noise when testing first order effects.

The approach involves analyzing web server logs to identify popular pages using TF-IDF; building normal resource access profile; generating query of accessed resources; and applying LSI technique to determine the similarity between a given session and known good sessions.

528|3041000|Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) is one of the most common but destructive kind of cyberattacks. The DDoS attack traffic vastly includes the SYN packets. To handle excessive DDoS traffic without large impact on the benign traffic, it is important to allocate sufficient resource for the defense. With the support from Network Function Virtualization (NFV) technology, this can be done in a significantly lower lower cost, with higher flexibility. In this work, we propose a DDoS defense mechanism based on Network Function Virtualization platform, which is capable to balance with the attack load. Our proposed mechanism uses dynamic network agents to intercept packets when the system experiences DDoS attack. In particular, we focus on the mechanism that deploys virtual agents dynamically according to the attack strength. The corresponding load-balancing algorithm dynamically determines the number of agents to allocate for defending the attack traffic. Our simulation results demonstrate that the mechanism can successfully defeat the DDoS attacks with different attack intensities, while it incurs minimal performance degradation on the benign traffic and keeps the increase in the server's response time sufficiently low compared to that of a successful DDoS attack.|||||||

530|2736229|Bloom-filter-based forwarding has been suggested to solve several fundamental problems in the current Internet, such as routing-table growth, multicast scalability issues, and denial-of-service (DoS) attacks by botnets. The proposed protocols are source-routed and include the delivery tree encoded as a Bloom filter in each packet. The network nodes forward packets based on this in-packet information without consulting routing tables and without storing per-flow state. We show that these protocols have critical vulnerabilities and make several false security assumptions. In particular, we present DoS attacks against broad classes of Bloom-filter-based protocols and conclude that the protocols are not ready for deployment on open networks.

535|972382|"In this paper, we propose a new approach to preventing and constraining denial-of-service (DoS) attacks. Instead of being able to send anything to anyone at any time, in our architecture, nodes must first obtain ""permission to send"" from the destination; a receiver provides tokens, or capabilities, to those senders whose traffic it agrees to accept. The senders then include these tokens in packets. This enables verification points distributed around the network to check that traffic has been certified as legitimate by both endpoints and the path in between, and to cleanly discard unauthorized traffic. We show that our approach addresses many of the limitations of the currently popular approaches to DoS based on anomaly detection, traceback, and pushback. Further, we argue that our approach can be readily implemented in today's technology, is suitable for incremental deployment, and requires no more of a security infrastructure than that already needed to fix BGP's security weaknesses. Finally, our proposal facilitates innovation in application and networking protocols, something increasingly curtailed by existing DoS measures."|||||||

Train future security engineers by introducing them to a controlled disaster, and inspire them to creatively search for a solution that will prevent such a cyber attack. If the Internet conduit to supported systems or the server resources needed to process requests become overwhelmed by invalid requests initiated by a hacker, legitimate clients will be unable to access online services. Attacks that utilize this overload technique are called Denial of Service or DoS attacks. Many mission critical services are time sensitive and can't tolerate time delays. Also, e-commerce sites can lose large sums of revenue when customers can't access their system. As a result, there is an increasing need for security engineers to fully understand the concepts behind DoS attacks in order to initiate the necessary countermeasures. This lab was created by undergraduates and shows how to successfully construct a DoS lab, as well as the methods used to isolate the lab environment from external networks. The isolated laboratory environment used is the IT Sandbox at an institution of higher education focused on educating IT engineers.

However, little attention has been focused on quantifying DoS resilience: Do ad hoc networks have sufficiently redundant paths and counter-DoS mechanisms to make DoS attacks largely ineffective? Or are there attack and system factors that can lead to devastating effects? In this paper, we design and study DoS attacks in order to assess the damage that difficult-to-detect attackers can cause. The first attack we study, called the JellyFish attack, is targeted against closed-loop flows such as TCP; although protocol compliant, it has devastating effects. The second is the Black Hole attack, which has effects similar to the JellyFish, but on open-loop flows. We quantify via simulations and analytical modeling the scalability of DoS attacks as a function of key performance parameters such as mobility, system size, node density, and counter-DoS strategy. One perhaps surprising result is that such DoS attacks can increase the capacity of ad hoc networks, as they starve multi-hop flows and only allow one-hop communication, a capacity-maximizing, yet clearly undesirable situation.|||||||
541|2507310|Denial of Service (DoS) attacks represent a major threat to network security, especially in today's networked world. There has been significant research in this area, primarily focused on mitigating and preventing DoS attacks affecting transport layer services. This paper addresses issues arising from a new variation of a DoS attack, namely the SlowPOST attack that affects Application Layer services. In SlowPOST, the malicious clients send data at a slow rate after the connection is established, and the server is left waiting for the data to arrive. These attacks are particularly devastating due to their ability to resist detection due to their protocol compliance. In addition, such attacks do not require the massive resources that DoS attacks normally require, making them easier to launch. Some solutions for this issue have already been deployed in some commercial servers. These solutions are based on either monitoring traffic or enforcing a time limit on the transmission of the protocol headers. In order to achieve reliable detection, the detection parameters need to adapt to the constantly changing traffic. This paper proposes a novel algorithm that uses the data rate of connections to evolve a threshold for determining potential attackers in SlowPOST. This proposed method is tested by subjecting a server to an attack, and it was observed that in the absence of this method, the servicing of legitimate requests is not completed.|||||||

Initial speculation was that this was well-designed cyber warfare from North Korea, but the truth is still unknown. What was even more surprising was how these critical infrastructures were still vulnerable after a decade of research on DDoS attacks. These particular incidents, the so-called 7.7 (July 7th) DDoS attacks, were highlighted not just because of their success but also because of their well-coordinated strategy. The 3.3 (March 3rd, 2011) DDoS attacks had similar characteristics to the 7.7 DDoS attacks, but they were not as successful because of the rapid vaccination of the zombie hosts. In this paper, we suggest that it is worthwhile to take a step back from the target side of the DDoS attacks and look at the problem in terms of network traffic from the attacker's side. We collected a unique large-scale sample of DDoS attack traffic from the two real-world incidents (not simulated), and we provide an analysis of traffic patterns from the perspective of the attacker's hosting network.|||||||

If no routers are compromised in a given domain, will it be always able to fulfill its QoS promises? If this is not the case, how many neighbors (and with what peering link capacities) does an adversary need to compromise to deny service to a specific pair of communicating hosts or, for a specific host, to deny service to some or all destinations?

Huge efforts from both academia and industry have been made on detection and defense of DDoS attacks. However, most detection and defense schemes do not directly aim at protecting the victim of attacks itself (e.g., servers) but attack sources or intermediate network units. Although locating and identifying attacking sources are critical to stop attacks and for legal procedure, rapid and efficient predicting DDoS attacks to happen in the server is more important to reduce damage caused by attacks and even prevent attacks from happening. However, this part has not been addressed sufficiently in the literature. In this paper, we first briefly review research efforts on DDoS attacks, and then discuss a method to define and quantify attacks to severs based on available service rates. This is because the server is often the direct victim of DDoS attacks and the one-point failure of the entire service system. No matter whether there are attacks undergoing, if a sever is overloaded even by normal service requests, the effect imposed to a service system is equivalent to that of attacks. A prediction method for the available service rate of the protected server is then proposed, which applies the Auto Regressive Integrated Auto Regressive (ARIMA) model. Finally, we investigate the proposed prediction method to predict DDoS attacks through simulation studies with NS2. The simulation results show that the prediction algorithm is effective to predict most attacks.|||||||

548|1377489|Recently, we have seen increasing numbers of denial of service (DoS) attacks against online services and Web applications either for extortion reasons or for impairing and even disabling the competition. These DoS attacks have increasingly targeted the application level. Application-level DoS attacks emulate the same request syntax and network-level traffic characteristics as those of legitimate clients, thereby making the attacks much harder to detect and counter. Moreover, such attacks often target bottleneck resources such as disk bandwidth, database bandwidth, and CPU resources. In this article, we propose handling DoS attacks by using a twofold mechanism. First, we perform admission control to limit the number of concurrent clients served by the online service. Admission control is based on port hiding that renders the online service invisible to unauthorized clients by hiding the port number on which the service accepts incoming requests. Second, we perform congestion control on admitted clients to allocate more resources to good clients. Congestion control is achieved by adaptively setting a client's priority level in response to the client's requests in a way that can incorporate application-level semantics. We present a detailed evaluation of the proposed solution using two sample applications: Apache HTTPD and the TPCW benchmark (running on Apache Tomcat and IBM DB2). Our experiments show that the proposed solution incurs low performance overhead and is resilient to DoS attacks.|||||||
