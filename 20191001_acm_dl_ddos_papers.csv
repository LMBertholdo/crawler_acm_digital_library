0,"Today botnets are responsible for most of the DDoS attacks on the Internet. Understanding the characteristics of such DDoS attacks is critical to develop effective DDoS mitigation schemes. In this poster, we present some preliminary findings, mainly concerning the distribution of the attackers, of today's DDoS attacks. Our investigation is based on 50,704 different Internet DDoS attacks collected within a seven-month period for activities across the globe. These attacks were launched by 674 botnet generations from 23 different bonet families with a total of 9026 victim IPs belonging to 1074 organizations that are collectively located in 186 countries. We find that different from the traditional widely distributed intuition, most of these DDoS attacks are not widely distributed as the attackers are mostly from the same region, i.e., highly regionalized. We also find that different botnet families have strong target preferences in the same area as well. These findings refresh our understanding on the modern DDoS attacks.",https://dl.acm.org/ft_gateway.cfm?id=2662382&ftid=1512480&dwn=1&CFID=160864435&CFTOKEN=c2c713ca164e64e2-09C23F89-E07A-49C7-D508CF0C99C1F49B,https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2662382&preflayout=flat,1.0,548,November 2014,POSTER: How Distributed Are Today's DDoS Attacks?,CCS '14: Proceedings of the 2014 ACM SIGSAC Conference on Computer and Communications Security
1,"The traditional physical power grid is evolving into a cyber-physical Smart Grid (SG) that links the cyber communication and computational elements with the physical control functions to dynamically integrate varied and geographically distributed energy producers/consumers. In the SG, the cyber elements of Wide Area Measurement Systems (WAMS) are deployed to provide the critical monitoring of the state of power transmission and distribution to accomplish real-time control of the grid. Unfortunately, the increasing adoption of such computing/communication cyber-technologies essential to providing the SG operations also opens the risk of the SG being vulnerable to cyberattacks. In particular, attacks such as Denial-of-Service (DoS) and Distributed DoS (DDoS) are of primary concern for WAMS where such attacks can compromise its safety-critical accuracy and responsiveness characteristics.",https://dl.acm.org/ft_gateway.cfm?id=3103164&ftid=1899463&dwn=1&CFID=160864435&CFTOKEN=c2c713ca164e64e2-09C23F89-E07A-49C7-D508CF0C99C1F49B,https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3103164&preflayout=flat,0.0,88,August 2017,Towards DDoS Attack Resilient Wide Area Monitoring Systems,"ARES '17: Proceedings of the 12th International Conference on Availability, Reliability and Security"

3,"Content Centric Networking represents a paradigm shift in the evolution and definition of modern network protocols. Many research efforts have been made with the purpose of proving the feasibility and the scalability of this proposal. Our main contribution is to provide an analysis of the Pending Interest Table memory requirements in real deployment scenarios, especially considering the impact of distributed denial of service attacks. In fact, the state that the protocol maintains for each resource request makes the routers more prone to resources exhaustion issues than in traditional stateless solutions. Our results are derived by using a full custom simulator and considering the different node architectures that have been proposed as valid reference models. The main outcomes point out differentiated weaknesses in each architecture we investigated and underline the need for improvements in terms of security and scalability.",https://dl.acm.org/ft_gateway.cfm?id=2491225&ftid=1389096&dwn=1&CFID=160864435&CFTOKEN=c2c713ca164e64e2-09C23F89-E07A-49C7-D508CF0C99C1F49B,https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2491225&preflayout=flat,7.0,223,August 2013,PIT overload analysis in content centric networks,ICN '13: Proceedings of the 3rd ACM SIGCOMM workshop on Information-centric networking

5,"Volumetric distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks can bring any network to a halt. Because of their distributed nature and high volume, the victim often cannot handle these attacks alone and needs help from upstream ISPs. Today's Internet has no automated mechanism for victims to ask ISPs for help in attack handling and ISPs themselves do not offer such services. We propose SENSS, a security service for collaborative mitigation of volumetric DDoS attacks. SENSS enables the victim of an attack to request attack monitoring and filtering on demand, and to pay for the services rendered. Requests can be sent both to the immediate and to remote ISPs, in an automated and secure manner, and can be authenticated by these ISPs, without having prior trust with the victim. Simple and generic SENSS APIs enable victims to build custom detection and mitigation approaches against a variety of DDoS attacks. SENSS is deployable with today's infrastructure, and it has strong economic incentives both for ISPs and for the attack victims. It is also very effective in sparse deployment, offering full protection to direct customers of early adopters, and considerable protection to remote victims when deployed strategically. Deployment on the largest 1% of ISPs protects not just direct customers of these ISPs, but everyone on the Internet, from 90% of volumetric DDoS attacks.",https://dl.acm.org/ft_gateway.cfm?id=3274717&ftid=2022466&dwn=1&CFID=160864435&CFTOKEN=c2c713ca164e64e2-09C23F89-E07A-49C7-D508CF0C99C1F49B,https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3274717&preflayout=flat,0.0,125,December 2018,SENSS Against Volumetric DDoS Attacks,ACSAC '18: Proceedings of the 34th Annual Computer Security Applications Conference
6,"Software-defined networks have introduced innovative changes in communication networks by separating and centralizing control plane from the data forwarding plane, making the network more manageable and adaptable. SDN is widely getting adapted in the IoT environment mainly for the reason of security. Although SDN enhances network security with the centralized control of network behavior, it has its own challenges in terms of security. SDN controller is prone to DoS/DDoS attacks where attackers may flood controller with a large number of new flows beyond the controller's capacity, causing network failure for legitimate users. These attacks could be worse in the IoT context due to its open nature. A verity of techniques has been proposed for SDN controller attack mitigation, each could be categorized based on entropy, time, trust management and scheduling schemes used differently, but trust-based request prioritization solutions are simplest among these due to their resource requirements and less response time. Our proposed technique for mitigation of DDoS attacks is even based on trust management but specifically crafted for IoT environment that ensures maximal and optimal utilization of available resources, with the aim to reduce the load on the controller while making contest against attack more effective.",https://dl.acm.org/ft_gateway.cfm?id=3342037&ftid=2082150&dwn=1&CFID=160864435&CFTOKEN=c2c713ca164e64e2-09C23F89-E07A-49C7-D508CF0C99C1F49B,https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3342037&preflayout=flat,0.0,9,July 2019,FlowJustifier: An optimized trust-based request prioritization approach for mitigation of SDN controller DDoS attacks in the IoT paradigm,ICFNDS '19: Proceedings of the 3rd International Conference on Future Networks and Distributed Systems

8,"The increase of Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attacks in volume, frequency, and complexity, combined with the constant required alertness for mitigating web application threats, has caused many website owners to turn to Cloud-based Security Providers (CBSPs) to protect their infrastructure. These solutions typically involve the rerouting of traffic from the original website through the CBSP's network, where malicious traffic can be detected and absorbed before it ever reaches the servers of the protected website. The most popular Cloud-based Security Providers do not require the purchase of dedicated traffic-rerouting hardware, but rely solely on changing the DNS settings of a domain name to reroute a website's traffic through their security infrastructure. Consequently, this rerouting mechanism can be completely circumvented by directly attacking the website's hosting IP address. Therefore, it is crucial for the security and availability of these websites that their real IP address remains hidden from potential attackers. In this paper, we discuss existing, as well as novel ""origin-exposing"" attack vectors which attackers can leverage to discover the IP address of the server where a website protected by a CBSP is hosted. To assess the impact of the discussed origin-exposing vectors on the security of CBSP-protected websites, we consolidate all vectors into CloudPiercer, an automated origin-exposing tool, which we then use to conduct the first large-scale analysis of the effectiveness of the origin-exposing vectors. Our results show that the problem is severe: 71.5% of the 17,877 CBSP-protected websites that we tested, expose their real IP address through at least one of the evaluated vectors. The results of our study categorically demonstrate that a comprehensive adoption of CBSPs is harder than just changing DNS records. Our findings can steer CBSPs and site administrators towards effective countermeasures, such as proactively scanning for origin exposure and using appropriate network configurations that can greatly reduce the threat.",https://dl.acm.org/ft_gateway.cfm?id=2813633&ftid=1630951&dwn=1&CFID=160864435&CFTOKEN=c2c713ca164e64e2-09C23F89-E07A-49C7-D508CF0C99C1F49B,https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2813633&preflayout=flat,7.0,739,October 2015,Maneuvering Around Clouds: Bypassing Cloud-based Security Providers,CCS '15: Proceedings of the 22nd ACM SIGSAC Conference on Computer and Communications Security
9,"TCP-targeted low-rate distributed denial-of-service (LDDoS) attacks have created an opportunity for attackers to reduce their total attaking rate (and hence, the detection probability of the attacks) while inflicting the same damage to TCP flows as traditional flooding-based DDoS attacks. CPR-based approach has been proposed by Zhang et al. to detect and filter this kind of DDoS attacks, but its performance in terms of TCP throughput under attack is shown to be limited by the way it calculates CPR for each flow. In this paper, we will propose some modifications to the CPR-based approach in order to increase its performance.

10,"DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service) attack is one of the most used DoS (Denial of Service) attack. It is a distributed attack in which an attacker uses a multitude of compromised computers to attack a single target. Those compromised computers that actually execute the attack are called botnet. To hide their identity, the attacker usually uses a third-party server to control and send attack command to bots, this kind of server is called C&C (command & control) server. The detection of C&C sessions is a strong proof of botnet detection and early detection of DDoS attacks as C&C connections occur before a DDoS attack. Network traffic analysis is an effective method to detect C&C sessions as it is hard to avoid encrypting the payload or change command code. We consider a new feature vector with 55 features, and use a random forest algorithm to build the classifier. Random forest is an ensemble of classifiers that can deal with high-dimension problems. In fact, it can also calculate the importance of features that will help us find the key features responsible for the detection of C&C sessions. Experimental results show that our approach has better performance on C&C session detection.",https://dl.acm.org/ft_gateway.cfm?id=3022260&ftid=1843773&dwn=1&CFID=160864435&CFTOKEN=c2c713ca164e64e2-09C23F89-E07A-49C7-D508CF0C99C1F49B,https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3022260&preflayout=flat,1.0,163,January 2017,C&C session detection using random forest,IMCOM '17: Proceedings of the 11th International Conference on Ubiquitous Information Management and Communication
11,"When a P2P system has millions of concurrently active peers, there is the risk that it could serve as a DDoS engine for attacks against a targeted host. In this paper we describe two approaches to creating a DDoS engine out of a P2P system: the first involves poisoning the distributed index in the peers; the second involves poisoning the routing tables in the peers. For both approaches, the targeted host does not have to be a participant in the P2P system, and could be a web server, a mail server, or a user's desktop. We then examine these two poisoning attacks in Overnet, a popular DHT-based P2P file-sharing system. By using limited poisoning attacks of short duration on Overnet's indexing and routing tables, we create DDoS attacks against a targeted host. We find that with modest effort, both DDoS attacks can direct significant traffic from diverse peers to the target.",https://dl.acm.org/ft_gateway.cfm?id=1146894&ftid=362323&dwn=1&CFID=160864435&CFTOKEN=c2c713ca164e64e2-09C23F89-E07A-49C7-D508CF0C99C1F49B,https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1146894&preflayout=flat,24.0,"1,416",May 2006,Exploiting P2P systems for DDoS attacks,InfoScale '06: Proceedings of the 1st international conference on Scalable information systems
12,"Cybercriminals are learning to harness the power of simpler devices like connected cameras. In September of 2016, Mirai software was used to infect more than 100,000 devices and unleash one of the largest distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks up to that time. After this incident, many people identified multiple large attacks coming from Internet of Things (IoT) devices, like CCTV cameras, and described these attacks as a new trend. A technique to detect whether a signal source is counterfeited in the initial stage of a DDoS attack is important. This paper proposes a method for the quick detection of a spoofed Internet protocol (IP) during a DDoS attack based on a DDoS shelter that is established to defend against DDoS attacks. In order to achieve this goal, we evaluate the number of time-to-live hops in normal traffic as a reference for the bandwidth of each network that is accessible to the DDoS shelter. In this study, we conduct an experiment using cases of actual DDoS attacks. As a result of this experiment, we prove that our proposed method quickly detects a spoofed IP.",https://dl.acm.org/ft_gateway.cfm?id=3185008&ftid=1944712&dwn=1&CFID=160864435&CFTOKEN=c2c713ca164e64e2-09C23F89-E07A-49C7-D508CF0C99C1F49B,https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3185008&preflayout=flat,0.0,167,February 2018,Study of detection method for spoofed IP against DDoS attacks,"Personal and Ubiquitous Computing: Volume 22 Issue 1, February 2018"

14,"Now a day's web services become key aspect of life. Unfortunately there are several threats to these services. These threats are phishing, e-mail borne viruses, Trojan horse programs, Denial of Service etc. Among of them Distributed Denial of Service attack is a strong and more energetic attack on the Internet. Launching of DDoS attack is an explicit attempt to exhaust the resources of server to prevent legitimate users to access services. The common flooding DDoS attacks can be detected and mitigated by some mechanisms easily cause of the characteristics as flow rate, size of attack packets, but still it is difficult to detect and identifies the Low-Rate DoS attack because the attacker periodically send short burst packets which behave as legitimate traffic to the server. The attack is only detected when the server goes down. So an efficient detection system is required which effectively Characterize the legitimate and attack traffic to detect the attack and stop it to mitigate the effect of these sort of threats. In this article we proposed a complete framework for ""Characterization, Detection and Mitigation of Low-Rate DoS Attacks"" which effectively characterize the flows as attack or legitimate, detects the low-rate DoS attack on the basis of characteristics of low rate and mitigate the effect of this by stopping the attack flow near the source.

15,"The idea of Internet of Things (IoT) is implanting networked heterogeneous detectors into our daily life. It opens extra channels for information submission and remote control to our physical world. A significant feature of an IoT network is that it collects data from network edges. Moreover, human involvement for network and devices maintenance is greatly reduced, which suggests an IoT network need to be highly self-managed and self-secured. For the reason that the use of IoT is growing in many important fields, the security issues of IoT need to be properly addressed. Among all, Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) is one of the most notorious attacking behaviors over network which interrupt and block genuine user requests by flooding the host server with huge number of requests using a group of zombie computers via geographically distributed internet connections.

Derived from the low layers, new application-layer-based DDoS attacks utilizing legitimate HTTP requests to overwhelm victim resources are more undetectable. The case may be more serious when such attacks mimic or occur during the flash crowd event of a popular Website. Focusing on the detection for such new DDoS attacks, a scheme based on document popularity is introduced. An Access Matrix is defined to capture the spatial-temporal patterns of a normal flash crowd. Principal component analysis and independent component analysis are applied to abstract the multidimensional Access Matrix. A novel anomaly detector based on hidden semi-Markov model is proposed to describe the dynamics of Access Matrix and to detect the attacks.

19,"The Internet's Domain Name System (DNS) is a frequent target of Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attacks, but such attacks have had very different outcomes---some attacks have disabled major public websites, while the external effects of other attacks have been minimal. While on one hand the DNS protocol is relatively simple, the system has many moving parts, with multiple levels of caching and retries and replicated servers. This paper uses controlled experiments to examine how these mechanisms affect DNS resilience and latency, exploring both the client side's DNS user experience, and server-side traffic. We find that, for about 30% of clients, caching is not effective. However, when caches are full they allow about half of clients to ride out server outages that last less than cache lifetimes, caching and retries together allow up to half of the clients to tolerate DDoS attacks longer than cache lifetimes, with 90% query loss, and almost all clients to tolerate attacks resulting in 50% packet loss. While clients may get service during an attack, tail-latency increases for clients. For servers, retries during DDoS attacks increase normal traffic up to 8x. Our findings about caching and retries help explain why users see service outages from some real-world DDoS events, but minimal visible effects from others.",https://dl.acm.org/ft_gateway.cfm?id=3278534&ftid=2012760&dwn=1&CFID=160864435&CFTOKEN=c2c713ca164e64e2-09C23F89-E07A-49C7-D508CF0C99C1F49B,https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3278534&preflayout=flat,0.0,209,October 2018,When the Dike Breaks: Dissecting DNS Defenses During DDoS,IMC '18: Proceedings of the Internet Measurement Conference 2018

We then analyze the broken incentive chain in each of these technological solutions. As a remedy, we propose usage-based pricing and Capacity Provision Networks, which enable victims to disseminate enough incentive along attack paths to stimulate cooperation against DDoS attacks.",https://dl.acm.org/ft_gateway.cfm?id=1189745&ftid=405386&dwn=1&CFID=160864435&CFTOKEN=c2c713ca164e64e2-09C23F89-E07A-49C7-D508CF0C99C1F49B,https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1189745&preflayout=flat,8.0,"1,746",February 2007,Defeating DDoS attacks by fixing the incentive chain,"ACM Transactions on Internet Technology (TOIT): Volume 7 Issue 1, February 2007"
23,"The Internet's Domain Name System (DNS) is a frequent target of Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attacks, but such attacks have had very different outcomes---some attacks have disabled major public websites, while the external effects of other attacks have been minimal. While on one hand the DNS protocol is relatively simple, the system has many moving parts, with multiple levels of caching and retries and replicated servers. This paper uses controlled experiments to examine how these mechanisms affect DNS resilience and latency, exploring both the client side's DNS user experience, and server-side traffic. We find that, for about 30% of clients, caching is not effective. However, when caches are full they allow about half of clients to ride out server outages that last less than cache lifetimes, caching and retries together allow up to half of the clients to tolerate DDoS attacks longer than cache lifetimes, with 90% query loss, and almost all clients to tolerate attacks resulting in 50% packet loss. While clients may get service during an attack, tail-latency increases for clients. For servers, retries during DDoS attacks increase normal traffic up to 8x. Our findings about caching and retries help explain why users see service outages from some real-world DDoS events, but minimal visible effects from others.",https://dl.acm.org/ft_gateway.cfm?id=3278534&ftid=2012760&dwn=1&CFID=160864435&CFTOKEN=c2c713ca164e64e2-09C23F89-E07A-49C7-D508CF0C99C1F49B,https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3278534&preflayout=flat,0.0,209,October 2018,When the Dike Breaks: Dissecting DNS Defenses During DDoS,IMC '18: Proceedings of the Internet Measurement Conference 2018

The packets may cross many networks to reach the destination during this process. To achieve its goals, the network layer must know about the topology, communication subnets and the version of the IP addresses used. The present version of IP is version 4 which must communicate with the next generation of IP addresses which is version 6. As both the versions of Internet Protocol must co-exist, we need some mechanisms that can help the transition process run smoothly. The old applications which are still using IP v4 should work smoothly with IP v6. We discuss IPv6 secure tunneling mechanism that has some advantages over the other models.

This leads to the necessity of a good DDoS prevention and detection techniques. The paper aims to provide a better solution to these problems using features analysis. The statistical characteristics or parameters of the incoming packets viz. MTI (mean time intervals), POIP (probability of occurrence of IP), TTL (time to live), ACK value, SYN value, time stamp field, differentiated service field and sequence number are analyzed. The incoming packets are classified into normal and attack packets by deploying Naïve Bayes classifier algorithm using the attack and normal profile from previously available datasets. Information gain algorithm is used to decrease the computation time, memory usage and increase efficiency of detection by reducing the number of parameters. The performance increases with more consistency after the application of information gain. The efficiencies of detection before and after the application of information gain are 98% and 99.5% respectively. The computation time is also reduced by 46.6%.

27,"This study stems from the premise that we need to break away from the ""reactive"" cycle of developing defenses against new DDoS attacks (e.g., amplification) by proactively investigating the potential for new types of DDoS attacks. Our specific focus is on pulsating attacks, a particularly debilitating type that has been hypothesized in the literature. In a pulsating attack, bots coordinate to generate intermittent pulses at target links to significantly reduce the throughput of TCP connections traversing the target. With pulsating attacks, attackers can cause significantly greater damage to legitimate users than traditional link flooding attacks. To date, however, pulsating attacks have been either deemed ineffective or easily defendable for two reasons: (1) they require a central coordinator and can thus be tracked; and (2) they require tight synchronization of pulses, which is difficult even in normal non-congestion scenarios. This paper argues that, in fact, the perceived drawbacks of pulsating attacks are in fact not fundamental. We develop a practical pulsating attack called CICADAS using two key ideas: using both (1) congestion as an implicit signal for decentralized implementation, and (2) a Kalman-filter-based approach to achieve tight synchronization. We validate CICADAS using simulations and wide-area experiments. We also discuss possible countermeasures against this attack.",https://dl.acm.org/ft_gateway.cfm?id=2897866&ftid=1730925&dwn=1&CFID=160864435&CFTOKEN=c2c713ca164e64e2-09C23F89-E07A-49C7-D508CF0C99C1F49B,https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2897866&preflayout=flat,1.0,122,May 2016,CICADAS: Congesting the Internet with Coordinated and Decentralized Pulsating Attacks,ASIA CCS '16: Proceedings of the 11th ACM on Asia Conference on Computer and Communications Security
28,"IP spoofing has often been exploited by Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks to: 1) conceal flooding sources and dilute localities in flooding traffic, and 2) coax legitimate hosts into becoming reflectors, redirecting and amplifying flooding traffic. Thus, the ability to filter spoofed IP packets near victim servers is essential to their own protection and prevention of becoming involuntary DoS reflectors. Although an attacker can forge any field in the IP header, he cannot falsify the number of hops an IP packet takes to reach its destination. More importantly, since the hop-count values are diverse, an attacker cannot randomly spoof IP addresses while maintaining consistent hop-counts. On the other hand, an Internet server can easily infer the hop-count information from the Time-to-Live (TTL) field of the IP header. Using a mapping between IP addresses and their hop-counts, the server can distinguish spoofed IP packets from legitimate ones. Based on this observation, we present a novel filtering technique, called Hop-Count Filtering (HCF)--which builds an accurate IP-to-hop-count (IP2HC) mapping table--to detect and discard spoofed IP packets. HCF is easy to deploy, as it does not require any support from the underlying network. Through analysis using network measurement data, we show that HCF can identify close to 90% of spoofed IP packets, and then discard them with little collateral damage. We implement and evaluate HCF in the Linux kernel, demonstrating its effectiveness with experimental measurements.",https://dl.acm.org/ft_gateway.cfm?id=1241836&ftid=412329&dwn=1&CFID=160864435&CFTOKEN=c2c713ca164e64e2-09C23F89-E07A-49C7-D508CF0C99C1F49B,https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1241836&preflayout=flat,46.0,"1,551",February 2007,Defense against spoofed IP traffic using hop-count filtering,"IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking (TON): Volume 15 Issue 1, February 2007"

These attacks are particularly challenging, since attackers can use a limited amount of resources to trigger exhaustion of a particular type of system resource on the server side. SplitStack resolves this by splitting the monolithic stack into many separable components called minimum splittable units (MSUs). If part of the application stack is experiencing a DDoS attack, SplitStack massively replicates just the affected MSUs, potentially across many machines. This allows scaling of the impacted resource separately from the rest of the application stack, so that resources can be precisely added where needed to combat the attack.

Due to scalability and economical reasons, SDN-WAN mostly uses an in-band control mechanism, which implies that control and data sharing the same critical physical links. However, the in-band control and centralized control architecture can be exploited by attackers to launch distributed denial of service (DDoS) on SDN control plane by flooding the shared links and/or the Open flow agents. Therefore, constructing a resilient software designed network requires dynamic isolation and distribution of the control flow to minimize damage and significantly increase attack cost. Existing solutions fall short to address this challenge because they require expensive extra dedicated resources or changes in OpenFlow protocol.

46,"Application layer (L7) Distributed Denial of Service attacks are becoming more common and an emerging threat to legitimate sites. The goal of these attacks is to prevent legitimate users from accessing a website. Due to the nature of the attacks, the low rate, and the sophisticated imitation of user behavior from automated bots, it is difficult to diagnose these on time. There is an evolving 'industry' of blackmailing and using these attacks for illegal profit [1]. Even though L7 DDoS attacks are a serious threat, studying and experimenting with them is challenging. Organizations do not share server logs because of privacy concerns. Furthermore, implementing these attacks requires instrumentation and real testbeds in order to produce realistic attacks for analysis. Therefore, it is difficult to evaluate mitigation and detection techniques. Our contribution is twofold. First, we have developed a set of testbeds on the GENI (Global Environment for Network Infrastructure) cloud infrastructure [2] to facilitate research and development of detection and mitigation techniques of L7 DDoS attacks. Second, we have used a library of attacks to perform post forensic analysis and classify L7 DDoS attacks based on their individual characteristics.

In this paper, we present a novel defense system called Dolus to mitigate the impact of DDoS attacks launched against high-value services hosted in SDxI-based cloud platforms. Our Dolus system is able to initiate a 'pretense' in a scalable and collaborative manner to deter the attacker based on threat intelligence obtained from attack feature analysis in a two-stage ensemble learning scheme. Using foundations from pretense theory in child play, Dolus takes advantage of elastic capacity provisioning via 'quarantine virtual machines' and SDxI policy co-ordination across multiple network domains to deceive the attacker by creating a false sense of success. From the time gained through pretense initiation, Dolus enables cloud service providers to decide on a variety of policies to mitigate the attack impact, without disrupting the cloud services experience for legitimate users. We evaluate the efficacy of Dolus using a GENI Cloud testbed and demonstrate its real-time capabilities to: (a) detect DDoS attacks and redirect attack traffic to quarantine resources to engage the attacker under pretense, and (b) coordinate SDxI policies to possibly block DDoS attacks closer to the attack source(s).",https://dl.acm.org/ft_gateway.cfm?id=3154346&ftid=1939885&dwn=1&CFID=160864435&CFTOKEN=c2c713ca164e64e2-09C23F89-E07A-49C7-D508CF0C99C1F49B,https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3154346&preflayout=flat,0.0,133,January 2018,Dolus: Cyber Defense using Pretense against DDoS Attacks in Cloud Platforms,ICDCN '18: Proceedings of the 19th International Conference on Distributed Computing and Networking

We also propose two algorithms for systematic placement of the defense nodes in the victim's upstream router network. We compare the performance and efficiency of the proposed algorithms through simulation results.

68,"With the continuous development of web services, the web security becomes more and more important. Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack as one of the most common form of attacks, has produced serious economic damages. DDoS attack detection as one of main defense methods is suffered increasing attention by researchers. Most of them use machine learning methods to make good detection performance. However, there are still gaps between real detection rate and expected one, conventional machine learning methods are limited compared with deep learning. In this paper, we propose DAD-MCNN, a multi-channel CNN(MC-CNN) based DDoS attack detection framework, which can fully utilize information from a huge amount of network packages and set up an earlier warning system. Our contributions can be summarized as follows: (1) we propose a new preprocessing method for the network dataset. (2) MC-CNN is applied to detect DDoS attack and the detection result is decided by data in respective channels. (3) We use incremental training method to optimize training procedures and time in MC-CNN. (4) The experiment result shows that MC-CNN has the highest accuracy compared with conventional machine learning methods.

72,"Several overlay-based solutions have been proposed to protect network servers from DoS/DDoS attacks. The common objective in the existing solutions is to prevent the attacking traffic from reaching the servers by hiding the location of target server computers. The recent evolutions in DDoS attacks, especially in the increase in the number of bots involved in a DDoS attack and in the degree of control such bots have to the hijacked host computers, cause serious threats to the overlay-based solutions. We designed and assessed the potential of the new overlay-based security architecture that addresses the recent evolutions in DDoS attacks. The new security architecture, called ""Dynamic Binary User-Splits (DBUS)"", is designed to protect cloud servers (a) when their legitimate users convert to DoS/DDoS attackers or (b) when DDoS attacks are launched from the legitimate users' host computers that are hijacked by DDoS coordinators. DBUS copes with the situations by sieving attacking traffic from the hijacked legitimate users' host computers using dynamic binary user splits over the migrating entry points to an overlay network. Our discrete event driven simulation suggested that DBUS will efficiently sieve DDoS attacking hosts in many different situations, when a small number of attacking hosts hide behind a large legitimate user group, or when a stampede of DDoS attacking hosts occupy the majority of incoming traffic, without requiring a large number of migrating entry points. We also found that how quickly each migrating entry point can detect excess traffic is a key to keep convergence delay short.",https://dl.acm.org/ft_gateway.cfm?id=2556900&ftid=1444081&dwn=1&CFID=160864435&CFTOKEN=c2c713ca164e64e2-09C23F89-E07A-49C7-D508CF0C99C1F49B,https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2556900&preflayout=flat,0.0,125,December 2013,Dynamic Binary User-Splits to Protect Cloud Servers from DDoS Attacks,ICCC '13: Proceedings of the Second International Conference on Innovative Computing and Cloud Computing

We explore the applicability of game theoretic approaches to the cyber security problem with focus on active bandwidth depletion attacks. We model the interaction between the attacker and the defender as a two-player non-zero-sum game in two attack scenarios: (i) one single attacking node for Denial of Service (DoS) and (ii) multiple attacking nodes for Distributed DoS (DDoS). The defender's challenge is to determine optimal firewall settings to block rogue traffics while allowing legitimate ones. Our analysis considers the worst-case scenario where the attacker also attempts to find the most effective sending rate or botnet size.

Consideration of varying tolerance factors make proposed detection system scalable to the varying network conditions and attack loads in real time. NS-2 network simulator on Linux platform is used as simulation testbed. Simulation results show that our proposed solution gives a drastic improvement in terms of detection rate and false positive rate.

These attacks are particularly challenging since attackers using limited resources can exhaust the resources of even well-provisioned servers. DeDoS resolves this by splitting monolithic software stacks into separable components called minimum splittable units (MSUs). If part of the application stack is experiencing a DDoS attack, DeDoS can massively replicate only the affected MSUs, potentially across many machines. This allows scaling of the impacted resource separately from the rest of the application stack so that resources can be precisely added where needed to combat the attack. Our demonstration will show that DeDoS incurs reasonable overheads in normal operations and that it significantly outperforms naïve replication when defending against a range of asymmetric attacks.",https://dl.acm.org/ft_gateway.cfm?id=3131990&ftid=1900240&dwn=1&CFID=160864435&CFTOKEN=c2c713ca164e64e2-09C23F89-E07A-49C7-D508CF0C99C1F49B,https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3131990&preflayout=flat,2.0,207,August 2017,A Demonstration of the DeDoS Platform for Defusing Asymmetric DDoS Attacks in Data Centers,SIGCOMM Posters and Demos '17: Proceedings of the SIGCOMM Posters and Demos
84,"Denial-of-Service attacks are the largest threat to Internet and the Internet of Things despite the fact that a large number of defense approaches has been proposed by the research community. In this paper we introduce IP Fast Hopping, effective network layer software solution against DDoS attacks. Our technology hides real IP address of a server behind a large pool of IP addresses belongs to a number of routers in different networks. Our method provides a network layer approach to prevent unauthorized access to a server that sometimes is important for the Internet of Things. Our approach implies real-time changing of server's IP address according to a schedule which is available only for authorized clients (so, our method is not applicable for publicly available Internet resources). This schedule is unique for each client connection and each entry in this schedule is being calculated dynamically on both edges of secured connection independently using a special pseudo-random function. To implement this requirement, during connection establishing between a new authorized client and the server, the client receives initial server's IP (which will be used for high level protocols on client side), pool of IP addresses (unordered set of IP address related to a set of ""edge"" routers) and unique session ID. The special network layer software installed on client's terminal changes destination IP address of the packet on an address from the IP pool according to value of a special pseudo-random function with the following arguments: session unique ID and time of packet's creation (value of timestamp field into TCP header). After that, this packet is being traversed to one of ""edge"" routers according to common switching protocols. The router checks (using the same pseudo-random function) that destination address is correct and, if yes, redirects this packet to real server IP or, otherwise, drops the packet. The same procedure is applied for server's responses to clients.",https://dl.acm.org/ft_gateway.cfm?id=2687238&ftid=1522628&dwn=1&CFID=160864435&CFTOKEN=c2c713ca164e64e2-09C23F89-E07A-49C7-D508CF0C99C1F49B,https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2687238&preflayout=flat,1.0,146,October 2014,IP fast hopping protocol design,CEE-SECR '14: Proceedings of the 10th Central and Eastern European Software Engineering Conference in Russia

IP Traceback is one of the security concerns that is associated with finding out the true origin of the attack/attacker.

Typically, the malicious user directs the attack towards the network layer, especially the controller plane which acts as the core of the network. However, the attack is redirected to the application layer when the attacker is defeated in the network layer.

94,"DoS attacks use IP spoofing to forge the source IP address of packets, and thereby hide the identity of the source. This makes it hard to defend against DoS attacks, so IP spoofing will still be used as an aggressive attack mechanism even under distributed attack environment. While many IP spoofing prevention techniques have been proposed, none have achieved widespread real-world use. One main reason is the lack of properties favoring incremental deployment, an essential component for the adoption of new technologies. A viable solution needs to be not only technically sound but also economically acceptable. An incrementally deploy-able protocol should have three properties: initial benefits for early adopters, incremental benefits for subsequent adopters, and effectiveness under partial deployment. Since no previous anti-spoofing solution satisfies all three of these properties, we propose a new mechanism called ""BGP Anti-Spoofing Extension"" (BASE). The BASE mechanism is an anti-spoofing protocol designed to fulfill the incremental deployment properties necessary for adoption in current Internet environments. Based on simulations we ran using a model of Internet AS connectivity, BASE shows desirable IP spoofing prevention capabilities under partial deployment. We find that just 30% deployment can drop about 97% of attack packets. Therefore, BASE not only provides adopters' benefit but also outperforms previous anti-spoofing mechanisms.",https://dl.acm.org/ft_gateway.cfm?id=1229293&ftid=422126&dwn=1&CFID=160864435&CFTOKEN=c2c713ca164e64e2-09C23F89-E07A-49C7-D508CF0C99C1F49B,https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1229293&preflayout=flat,7.0,618,March 2007,BASE: an incrementally deployable mechanism for viable IP spoofing prevention,"ASIACCS '07: Proceedings of the 2nd ACM symposium on Information, computer and communications security"

96,"With the recent advances in software-defined networking (SDN), the multi-tenant data centers provide more efficient and flexible cloud platform to their subscribers. However, as the number, scale, and diversity of distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack is dramatically escalated in recent years, the availability of those platforms is still under risk. We note that the state-of-art DDoS protection architectures did not fully utilize the potential of SDN and network function virtualization (NFV) to mitigate the impact of attack traffic on data center network. Therefore, in this paper, we exploit the flexibility of SDN and NFV to propose FlexProtect, a flexible distributed DDoS protection architecture for multi-tenant data centers. In FlexProtect, the detection virtual network functions (VNFs) are placed near the service provider and the defense VNFs are placed near the edge routers for effectively detection and avoid internal bandwidth consumption, respectively. Based on the architecture, we then propose FP-SYN, an anti-spoofing SYN flood protection mechanism. The emulation and simulation results with real-world data demonstrates that, compared with the traditional approach, the proposed architecture can significantly reduce 46% of the additional routing path and save 60% internal bandwidth consumption.

98,"A Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack is an attempt to make an online service, a network, or even an entire organization, unavailable by saturating it with traffic from multiple sources. DDoS attacks are among the most common and most devastating threats that network defenders have to watch out for. DDoS attacks are becoming bigger, more frequent, and more sophisticated. Volumetric attacks are the most common types of DDoS attacks. A DDoS attack is considered volumetric, or high-rate, when within a short period of time it generates a large amount of packets or a high volume of traffic. High-rate attacks are well-known and have received much attention in the past decade; however, despite several detection and mitigation strategies have been designed and implemented, high-rate attacks are still halting the normal operation of information technology infrastructures across the Internet when the protection mechanisms are not able to cope with the aggregated capacity that the perpetrators have put together. With this in mind, the present paper aims to propose and test a distributed and collaborative architecture for online high-rate DDoS attack detection and mitigation based on an in-memory distributed graph data structure and unsupervised machine learning algorithms that leverage real-time streaming data and analytics.

110,"Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks especially distributed DoS (DDoS) attacks have become significant and increasing threats to the Internet. Huge efforts from both academia and industry have been made on detection and defense of DDoS attacks. However, most detection and defense schemes do not directly aim at protecting the victim of attacks itself (e.g., servers) but attack sources or intermediate network units. Although locating and identifying attacking sources are critical to stop attacks and for legal procedure, rapid and efficient predicting DDoS attacks to happen in the server is more important to reduce damage caused by attacks and even prevent attacks from happening. However, this part has not been addressed sufficiently in the literature. In this paper, we first briefly review research efforts on DDoS attacks, and then discuss a method to define and quantify attacks to severs based on available service rates. This is because the server is often the direct victim of DDoS attacks and the one-point failure of the entire service system. No matter whether there are attacks undergoing, if a sever is overloaded even by normal service requests, the effect imposed to a service system is equivalent to that of attacks. A prediction method for the available service rate of the protected server is then proposed, which applies the Auto Regressive Integrated Auto Regressive (ARIMA) model.

Non-volumetric attacks, unlike their noisy counterparts, require more sophisticated detection mechanisms, and typically have only post-facto and targeted protocol/application mitigations.

We describe the concept, implementation, and initial evaluation of the ARMED Network Actors (ANAs) that facilitate transparent interception, sensing, analysis, and mounting of adaptive responses that can disrupt the adversary's decision process.",https://dl.acm.org/ft_gateway.cfm?id=3103151&ftid=1899494&dwn=1&CFID=73804999&CFTOKEN=5ede92e20e41d14d-19D8B984-076C-E49D-F17D55E55ADB33F9,https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3103151&preflayout=flat,0,106,August 2017,Adaptive Resource Management Enabling Deception (ARMED),"ARES '17: Proceedings of the 12th International Conference on Availability, Reliability and Security"
113,"It is widely recognized that distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks can disrupt electronic commerce and cause large revenue losses. However, effective defenses continue to be mostly unavailable. We describe and evaluate VIPnet, a novel value-added network service for protecting e-commerce and other transaction-based sites from DDoS attacks. In VIPnet, e-merchants pay Internet Service Providers (ISPs) to carry the packets of the e-merchants' best clients (called VIPs) in a privileged class of service (CoS), protected from congestion, whether malicious or not, in the regular CoS. VIPnet rewards VIPs with not only better quality of service, but also greater availability. Because VIP rights are client- and server-specific, cannot be forged, are usage-limited, and are only replenished after successful client transactions (e.g., purchases), it is impractical for attackers to mount and sustain DDoS attacks against an e-merchant's VIPs. VIPnet can be deployed incrementally and does not require universal adoption. Experiments demonstrate VIPnet's benefits.",https://dl.acm.org/ft_gateway.cfm?id=511518&ftid=70854&dwn=1&CFID=73804999&CFTOKEN=5ede92e20e41d14d-19D8B984-076C-E49D-F17D55E55ADB33F9,https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=511518&preflayout=flat,5,"1,698",May 2002,Protecting electronic commerce from distributed denial-of-service attacks,WWW '02: Proceedings of the 11th international conference on World Wide Web

121,"Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) is one of the most common but destructive kind of cyberattacks. The DDoS attack traffic vastly includes the SYN packets. To handle excessive DDoS traffic without large impact on the benign traffic, it is important to allocate sufficient resource for the defense. With the support from Network Function Virtualization (NFV) technology, this can be done in a significantly lower lower cost, with higher flexibility. In this work, we propose a DDoS defense mechanism based on Network Function Virtualization platform, which is capable to balance with the attack load. Our proposed mechanism uses dynamic network agents to intercept packets when the system experiences DDoS attack. In particular, we focus on the mechanism that deploys virtual agents dynamically according to the attack strength. The corresponding load-balancing algorithm dynamically determines the number of agents to allocate for defending the attack traffic. Our simulation results demonstrate that the mechanism can successfully defeat the DDoS attacks with different attack intensities, while it incurs minimal performance degradation on the benign traffic and keeps the increase in the server's response time sufficiently low compared to that of a successful DDoS attack.",https://dl.acm.org/ft_gateway.cfm?id=3041000&ftid=1861513&dwn=1&CFID=73804999&CFTOKEN=5ede92e20e41d14d-19D8B984-076C-E49D-F17D55E55ADB33F9,https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3041000&preflayout=flat,0,215,March 2017,Dynamic DDoS Defense Resource Allocation using Network Function Virtualization,SDN-NFVSec '17: Proceedings of the ACM International Workshop on Security in Software Defined Networks & Network Function Virtualization

136,"Bloom filter (BF) based forwarding is an effective approach to implement scalable multicasting. The forwarding BF carried by each packet can encode either multicast tree or destination IP addresses, which are termed as tree oriented approach (TOA) and destination oriented approach (DOA), respectively. Studies have indicated that TOA based protocols have serious vulnerabilities under some distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks, and raised doubt about deployability of BF based multicasting. However, security analysis for DOA based protocols is still unavailable, and the fundamental effect of in-packet routing information on security performance of BF based multicast protocols is yet to be revealed. In this paper, we present a systematic analysis of security performance of BF based multicasting. Important DDoS attacks and the corresponding defending mechanisms are studied in the context of DOA. We have positive findings that DOA, with convenient enhancement, has a robust performance in resisting a variety of DDoS attacks that can deny service of TOA based protocols.

They are not suitable for handling the new type of attack which is based on the application layer. In this paper, we introduce a new scheme to achieve early attack detection and filtering for the application-layer-based DDoS attack. An extended hidden semi-Markov model is proposed to describe the browsing behaviors of web surfers. In order to reduce the computational amount introduced by the model's large state space, a novel forward algorithm is derived for the online implementation of the model based on the M-algorithm. Entropy of the user's HTTP request sequence fitting to the model is used as a criterion to measure the user's normality.

The lack of security in devices connected to the IoT is making them hot targets for cyber-criminals and strength of botnet attacks have increased drastically. Botnets are the technological backbones of multitudinous attacks including Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS), SPAM, identity theft and organizational spying. The 2016 Dyn cyber attack involved multiple DDoS attacks with an estimated throughput of 1.2 terabits per second; the attack is the largest DDoS attack on record.

140,"Denial-of-Service (DoS) and Distributed DoS (DDoS) attacks can cause serious problems in wireless networks due to its limited network/host resources. Attacker traceback is a promising solution to take a proper countermeasure near the attack origin, for forensics, and to discourage attacker from launching attacks. However, attacker traceback in wireless multi-hop networks is a challenging problem, and existing attacker traceback schemes developed for the Internet cannot be directly applied to wireless multi-hop networks due to the peculiar characteristics of wireless multi-hop networks (e.g., dynamic/autonomous network topology, limited network/host resources such as memory and bandwidth). We introduce a protocol framework for attacker traceback geared toward wireless multi-hop networks with special attention to cross-layer abnormality monitoring. The basic building blocks of our protocol framework consist of abnormality detection, abnormality characterization, abnormality searching, abnormality matching, and countermeasure. We show that our protocol framework successfully tracks down attacker (Avg. of 100% in DoS attacker traceback, avg. of 96% in DDoS attacker traceback) under diverse network environments (e.g., high background traffic, DDoS attack, and partial node compromise) with low communication, computation, and memory overhead.",https://dl.acm.org/ft_gateway.cfm?id=1180361&ftid=386254&dwn=1&CFID=73804999&CFTOKEN=5ede92e20e41d14d-19D8B984-076C-E49D-F17D55E55ADB33F9,https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1180361&preflayout=flat,0,806,October 2006,Attacker traceback with cross-layer monitoring in wireless multi-hop networks,SASN '06: Proceedings of the fourth ACM workshop on Security of ad hoc and sensor networks

However, fixed flow-monitoring application (i.e. NetFlow) is highly subjected to cache timeout hence lacks the support for a near real-time detection.

143,"Denial of Service (DoS)/ DDoS attack is a common and severe problem for network security researchers and practitioners. Attackers often generate attack traffic that behaves similar to normal network traffic using sophisticated attacking tools. Many intrusion detection systems fail to detect anomalous packets in real time. In this paper, we use a Multivariate Correlation Analysis (MCA) approach to distinguish attack traffic from normal traffic. This statistical measure is used to analyze the behavior of network traffic for attack detection. Since DDoS attack traffic behaves differently from legitimate network traffic, statistical properties of various parameters reflect the changed behavior of network traffic. We extract three basic parameters of network traffic, viz., entropy of source IPs, variation of source IPs and packet rate to analyze the behavior of network traffic during attack detection.

145,"The technology of today is dramatically more advanced than it was 30 years ago. With fiber optic cables becoming ever more present and the rapid expansion of storage, the volume of data passing through these devices is also becoming more abundant. Over time, it has become easier to launch many kinds of attacks. These attacks are often launched from one computer sending huge amounts of spoofed data for several minutes. It is no surprise then that multiple computers launching an attack will create a dire situation regardless of which PC or server is being attacked. A Denial of Service (DoS) attack occurs when an attacker floods a computer or server with illegitimate data so that the system will deny service to a legitimate user [3]. This occurs because that system is now lacking the resources to handle any more data. A Distributed DoS (DDoS) attack is the same idea, but amplified. A DDoS attack involves multiple systems striking a single target and flooding that target with data, overloading the target's computers, servers, and firewalls [3]. This often causes the physical devices to exhaust and deny legitimate requests. As if that wasn't enough, the attacker can plant a virus or Trojan in the system once they gain access to further sabotage the target. These types of attacks are very damaging to companies all around the world. That is where the Cisco ASA 5500 series firewall comes in. In this paper, we will be examining how efficiently a firewall of this type can defend against a DoS attack and a DDoS attack, and what adverse effects are displayed after the attacks have occurred.",https://dl.acm.org/ft_gateway.cfm?id=3077305&ftid=1872890&dwn=1&CFID=73804999&CFTOKEN=5ede92e20e41d14d-19D8B984-076C-E49D-F17D55E55ADB33F9,https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3077305&preflayout=flat,0,58,April 2017,Determining the Penetration Threshold for an ASA 5500 Firewall,ACM SE '17: Proceedings of the SouthEast Conference

163,"Today distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks are causing major problems to conduct online business over the Internet. Recently several schemes have been proposed on how to prevent some of these attacks, but they suffer from a range of problems, some of them being impractical and others not being effective against these attacks. In this paper, we propose a Controller-Agent model that would greatly minimize DDoS attacks on Internet. With a new packet marking technique and agent design our scheme is able to identify the approximate source of attack (nearest router) with a single packet even in case of attack with spoofed source addresses. Our scheme is invoked only during attack times, is able to process the victims traffic separately without disturbing other traffic, is able to establish different attack signatures for different attacking sources, can prevent the attack traffic at the nearest router to the attacking system, has fast response time, is simple in its implementation and can be incrementally deployed. Hence we believe that the scheme proposed in this paper seems to be a promising approach to prevent distributed denial of service attacks",https://dl.acm.org/ft_gateway.cfm?id=783137&ftid=157358&dwn=1&CFID=73804999&CFTOKEN=5ede92e20e41d14d-19D8B984-076C-E49D-F17D55E55ADB33F9,https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=783137&preflayout=flat,14,"2,387",February 2003,A practical method to counteract denial of service attacks,ACSC '03: Proceedings of the 26th Australasian computer science conference - Volume 16
164,"Traditionally, network and system configurations are static. Attackers have plenty of time to exploit the system's vulnerabilities and thus they are able to choose when to launch attacks wisely to maximize the damage. An unpredictable system configuration can significantly lift the bar for attackers to conduct successful attacks. Recent years, moving target defense (MTD) has been advocated for this purpose. An MTD mechanism aims to introduce dynamics to the system through changing its configuration continuously over time, which we call adaptations. Though promising, the dynamic system reconfiguration introduces overhead to the applications currently running in the system. It is critical to determine the right time to conduct adaptations and to balance the overhead afforded and the security levels guaranteed. This problem is known as the MTD timing problem. Little prior work has been done to investigate the right time in making adaptations. In this paper, we take the first step to both theoretically and experimentally study the timing problem in moving target defenses. For a broad family of attacks including DDoS attacks and cloud covert channel attacks, we model this problem as a renewal reward process and propose an optimal algorithm in deciding the right time to make adaptations with the objective of minimizing the long-term cost rate. In our experiments, both DDoS attacks and cloud covert channel attacks are studied.

166,"Denial of service (DoS) attack on the Internet has become a pressing problem. In this paper, we describe and evaluate route-based distributed packet filtering (DPF), a novel approach to distributed DoS (DDoS) attack prevention. We show that DPF achieves proactiveness and scalability, and we show that there is an intimate relationship between the effectiveness of DPF at mitigating DDoS attack and power-law network topology.The salient features of this work are two-fold. First, we show that DPF is able to proactively filter out a significant fraction of spoofed packet flows and prevent attack packets from reaching their targets in the first place. The IP flows that cannot be proactively curtailed are extremely sparse so that their origin can be localized---i.e., IP traceback---to within a small, constant number of candidate sites. We show that the two proactive and reactive performance effects can be achieved by implementing route-based filtering on less than 20% of Internet autonomous system (AS) sites. Second, we show that the two complementary performance measures are dependent on the properties of the underlying AS graph. In particular, we show that the power-law structure of Internet AS topology leads to connectivity properties which are crucial in facilitating the observed performance effects.",https://dl.acm.org/ft_gateway.cfm?id=383061&ftid=68530&dwn=1&CFID=73804999&CFTOKEN=5ede92e20e41d14d-19D8B984-076C-E49D-F17D55E55ADB33F9,https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=383061&preflayout=flat,136,"3,055",August 2001,On the effectiveness of route-based packet filtering for distributed DoS attack prevention in power-law internets,"SIGCOMM '01: Proceedings of the 2001 conference on Applications, technologies, architectures, and protocols for computer communications"
167,"Due to proliferation of diverse network applications, DoS/DDoS attacks are evolving. Many studies have been performed and implemented in on/off-line network devices such as routers and IDS/IPS. While IDS/IPS is powerful enough to handle deep packet inspection (DPI) tasks, routers are better suited in real-time and line-speed processing requirements. Since the routers are designed to handle IP packet header information, if one can devise an DoS/DDoS detection/prevention methods that utilizes the router specific features it will be best for the in-line and real-time processing. We introduce a Flow based DoS/DDoS detection algorithm(FDDA) that detects Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks by monitoring TTL and ID fields of incoming packet's IP header. As DDoS attacks are based on IP source address spoofing, the TTL and ID fields may have abnormal behavior. The device keeps track of 8-tuple flow table. The behavior of these two fields is monitored to determine DoS/DDoS attack situation.

168,"The need to keep an attacker oblivious of an attack mitigation effort is a very important component of a defense against denial of services (DoS) and distributed denial of services (DDoS) attacks because it helps to dissuade attackers from changing their attack patterns. Conceptually, DDoS mitigation can be achieved by two components. The first is a decoy server that provides a service function or receives attack traffic as a substitute for a legitimate server. The second is a decoy network that restricts attack traffic to the peripheries of a network, or which reroutes attack traffic to decoy servers. In this paper, we propose the use of a two-stage map table extension Locator/ID Separation Protocol (LISP) to realize a decoy network. We also describe and demonstrate how LISP can be used to implement an oblivious DDoS mitigation mechanism by adding a simple extension on the LISP MapServer. Together with decoy servers, this method can terminate DDoS traffic on the ingress end of an LISP-enabled network. We verified the effectiveness of our proposed mechanism through simulated DDoS attacks on a simple network topology.

170,"Large-scale bandwidth-based distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks can quickly knock out substantial parts of a network before reactive defenses can respond. Even traffic that is not under direct attack can suffer significant collateral damage if the traffic passes through links that are common to attack routes. This paper presents a Proactive Surge Protection (PSP) mechanism that aims to provide a broad first line of defense against DDoS attacks. The approach aims to minimize collateral damage by providing bandwidth isolation between traffic flows. The proposed solution is readily deployable using existing router mechanisms and does not rely on any unauthenticated packet header information. Our extensive evaluation across two large commercial backbone networks, using both distributed and targeted attacks, shows that up to 95.5% of the network could suffer collateral damage, but our solution was able to significantly reduce the amount of collateral damage by up to 97.58% in terms of the number of packets dropped and 90.36% in terms of the number of flows with packet loss.

Whereas DNS-based redirection requires a complex global traffic manager, anycast depends on BGP to direct a client to a CDN front-end. Anycast is simple to operate, scalable, and naturally resilient to DDoS attacks. This simplicity, however, comes at the cost of precise control of client redirection. We examine the performance implications of using anycast in a global, latency-sensitive, CDN.

201,"Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attacks continue to be a major threat on the Internet today. DDoS attacks overwhelm target services with requests or other traffic, causing requests from legitimate users to be shut out. A common defense against DDoS is to replicate a service in multiple physical locations/sites. If all sites announce a common prefix, BGP will associate users around the Internet with a nearby site, defining the catchment of that site. Anycast defends against DDoS both by increasing aggregate capacity across many sites, and allowing each site's catchment to contain attack traffic, leaving other sites unaffected. IP anycast is widely used by commercial CDNs and for essential infrastructure such as DNS, but there is little evaluation of anycast under stress. This paper provides the first evaluation of several IP anycast services under stress with public data. Our subject is the Internet's Root Domain Name Service, made up of 13 independently designed services (""letters"", 11 with IP anycast) running at more than 500 sites. Many of these services were stressed by sustained traffic at 100× normal load on Nov. 30 and Dec. 1, 2015. We use public data for most of our analysis to examine how different services respond to stress, and identify two policies: sites may absorb attack traffic, containing the damage but reducing service to some users, or they may withdraw routes to shift both good and bad traffic to other sites. We study how these deployment policies resulted in different levels of service to different users during the events. We also show evidence of collateral damage on other services located near the attacks.",https://dl.acm.org/ft_gateway.cfm?id=2987446&ftid=1811682&dwn=1&CFID=73804999&CFTOKEN=5ede92e20e41d14d-19D8B984-076C-E49D-F17D55E55ADB33F9,https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2987446&preflayout=flat,8,404,November 2016,Anycast vs. DDoS: Evaluating the November 2015 Root DNS Event,IMC '16: Proceedings of the 2016 Internet Measurement Conference

It has important applications in detecting port scans and distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks, measuring the infection rate of a worm, assisting resource allocation in a server farm, determining popular Web contents for caching, to name a few. The main technical challenge is to fit a spread estimator in a fast but small memory (such as SRAM) in order to operate it at the line speed in a high-speed network. In this paper, we design a new spread estimator that delivers good performance in tight memory space where all existing estimators no longer work. The new estimator not only achieves space compactness, but operates more efficiently than the existing ones. Its accuracy and efficiency come from a new method for data storage, called virtual vectors, which allow us to measure and remove the errors in spread estimation.

By extending SMTP to pull messages instead of receiving them an attempt to stem the flood of spam is made. The pull-based approach works without involvement of the end-users.

207,"The monitoring of unused Internet address space has been shown to be an effective method for characterizing Internet threats including Internet worms and DDOS attacks. Because there are no legitimate hosts in an unused address block, traffic must be the result of misconfiguration, backscatter from spoofed source addresses, or scanning from worms and other probing. This paper extends previous work characterizing traffic seen at specific unused address blocks by examining differences observed between these blocks. While past research has attempted to extrapolate the results from a small number of blocks to represent global Internet traffic, we present evidence that distributed address blocks observe dramatically different traffic patterns. This work uses a network of blackhole sensors which are part of the Internet Motion Sensor (IMS) collection infrastructure. These sensors are deployed in networks belonging to service providers, large enterprises, and academic institutions representing a diverse sample of the IPv4 address space. We demonstrate differences in traffic observed along three dimensions: over all protocols and services, over a specific protocol and service, and over a particular worm signature.

However, MTD based approaches for route mutation are oriented towards re-configuring the parameters in Local Area Networks (LANs), and do not provide any protection against infrastructure level attacks, which inherently limits their use for mission critical services over the Internet infrastructure. To cope with these issues, we extend the current routing architecture to consider end-hosts as routing elements, and present a formal method based agile defense mechanism to embed resiliency in the existing cyber infrastructure. The major contributions of this paper include: (1) formalization of efficient and resilient End to End (E2E) reachability problem as a constraint satisfaction problem, which identifies the potential end-hosts to reach a destination while satisfying resilience and QoS constraints, (2) design and implementation of a novel decentralized End Point Route Mutation (EPRM) protocol, and (3) design and implementation of planning algorithm to minimize the overlap between multiple flows, for the sake of maximizing the agility in the system. Our PlanetLab based implementation and evaluation validates the correctness, effectiveness and scalability of the proposed approach.",https://dl.acm.org/ft_gateway.cfm?id=2995275&ftid=1805875&dwn=1&CFID=73804999&CFTOKEN=5ede92e20e41d14d-19D8B984-076C-E49D-F17D55E55ADB33F9,https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2995275&preflayout=flat,0,248,October 2016,Formal Approach for Resilient Reachability based on End-System Route Agility,MTD '16: Proceedings of the 2016 ACM Workshop on Moving Target Defense
209,"As the Industry 4.0 or Internet of Things (IoT) era begins, security plays a key role in the Industry Internet of Things (IIoT) due to various threats, which include escape or Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attackers in the virtualization layer and vulnerability exploiters in the device layer. A successful cross-VM escape attack in the virtualization layer combined with cross-layer penetration in the device layer, which we define as an Advanced Persistent Escaper (APE), poses a great threat. Therefore, the development of detection and rejection methods for APEs across multiple layers in IIoT is an open issue. To the best of our knowledge, less effective methods are established, especially for vulnerability exploitation in the virtualization layer and backdoor leverage in the device layer. On the basis of this, we propose Escaper Cops (EscaperCOP), a detection method for cross-VM escapers in the virtualization layer and cross-layer penetrators in the device layer. In particular, a new detection method for guest-to-host escapers is proposed for the virtualization layer. Finally, a novel encryption method based on Identity-based Broadcast Encryption (IBBE) is proposed to protect the critical components in EscaperCOP, detection library, and control command library. To verify our method, experimental tests are performed for a large number of APEs in an IIoT framework.

210,"Currently, there is no effective defense against large-scale distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks. While numerous DDoS defense systems exist that offer excellent protection from specific attack types and scenarios, they can frequently be defeated by an attacker aware of their weaknesses. A necessary requirement for successful DDoS defense is wide deployment, but none of these systems can guarantee wide deployment simply because deployment depends more on market and social aspects than on the technical performance of the system.To successfully handle the DDoS threat we must abandon the current paradigm---the design of defense systems that operate in isolation---and shift toward a new paradigm, a distributed framework of heterogeneous systems that cooperate to achieve an effective defense. Heterogeneity is dictated by two major factors. First, the necessary requirements for a successful defense are detection, response and traffic differentiation. These requirements must be met at disjoint points in the Internet and require a disjoint set of functionalities from the defense systems. Second, heterogeneity is dictated by the current state of the DDoS defense field in which numerous systems exist that can offer similar performance and compete for market share. In this paper we show how the paradigm shift can be accomplished quickly and painlessly through the design of DefCOM, a distributed framework that enables the exchange of information and services between existing defense nodes.",https://dl.acm.org/ft_gateway.cfm?id=986658&ftid=264538&dwn=1&CFID=73804999&CFTOKEN=5ede92e20e41d14d-19D8B984-076C-E49D-F17D55E55ADB33F9,https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=986658&preflayout=flat,20,"1,121",August 2003,Alliance formation for DDoS defense,NSPW '03: Proceedings of the 2003 workshop on New security paradigms

Most of the Researchers dedicate in analyzing the random domains used for DGA (Domain Generation Algorithm) malware C&C communication rather than the DNS water torture attack. In order to get more facts about the nature of this kind of attacks, we compare behaviors of the DNS water torture attack with the DGA malware and disposable service from three aspects, i.e., time pattern, lexical property and the participants (clients and victims). Based on a month of real-world DNS traffic, we find that, first, the volume of the DNS water torture attack is significantly larger than the volume of disposable domains and DGA queries. Second, the character distribution of domains generated in the DNS water torture attacks are more random than disposable domains and DGA domains. Third, the client IP launching the DNS water torture attack are all random generated fake addresses. Fourth, the victims are themselves lawbreaker, e.g., pornographic website and gambling website.

Detecting Botnets is a difficult task in due to the complexity and performance issues when analyzing the huge amount of data from real large-scale networks. In major Botnet malware, the use of Domain Generation Algorithms allows to decrease possibility to be detected using white list - blacklist scheme and thus DGA Botnets have higher survival. This paper proposes a DGA Botnet detection scheme based on DNS traffic analysis which utilizes semantic measures such as entropy, meaning the level of the domain, frequency of n-gram appearances and Mahalanobis distance for domain classification. The proposed method is an improvement of Phoenix botnet detection mechanism, where in the classification phase, the modified Mahalanobis distance is used instead of the original for classification. The clustering phase is based on modified k-means algorithm for archiving better effectiveness. The effectiveness of the proposed method was measured and compared with Phoenix, Linguistic and SVM Light methods.

This problem is central to combating abusive traffic, such as DDoS attacks, ad click fraud and email spam. We share our experience building a general framework at Google for estimating the number of users behind IPs, called hereinafter the sizes of the IPs. The primary goal of this framework is combating abusive traffic without violating the user privacy. The estimation techniques produce statistically sound estimates of sizes relying solely on passively mining aggregated application log data, without probing machines or deploying active content like Java applets. This paper also explores using the estimated sizes to detect and filter abusive traffic. The proposed framework was used to build and deploy an ad click fraud filter at Google. The first 50M clicks tagged by the filter had a significant recall of all tagged clicks, and their false positive rate was below 1.4%.

The advantages of cloud computing are lucrative for well-established organizations looking to reduce infrastructure cost overheads. However, the users are not quite confident in entrusting their data to the cloud due to security threats and risks perceived in the cloud domain. Issues involving privacy requirements for the cloud and best practices in the cloud are suggested in this paper. Although the cloud provider ensures security in the cloud yet the flow of data, storage location, data computing process and security breaches are not transparent to the cloud customer. This distrust and lack of control on data is a major hindrance for potential cloud customers in adopting the cloud models for their businesses. Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs) are widely used to detect malicious activities. However existing solutions with IDSs involving DDoS and other non-detectable events may not be suitable in applying to the cloud due to distributed data storage and a major shift in Internet access mechanisms offered by cloud providers. Hence there is a strong need to analyze an appropriate IDS to counter DDoS attacks in the cloud.

The reliability of the platform is threatened by anomalous access behaviors such as resource abuse, DDoS attacks etc. Detecting anomalous behaviors to access the cloud service platform is an essential task. In this paper, an anomaly detection method based on Max-min distance and Support vector data description (MMD-SVDD) is proposed. The method identifies anomalous user access behaviors using CPU/memory/disk/network related system resource metrics. It firstly uses MMD to divide servers in the cloud service platform into multi-clusters. The servers in each of the clusters have similar running environment and can share an anomaly detection model. This process can effectively reduce the detection scale and system resource consumption. Then, aiming at the problem of incomplete abnormal data samples, the anomaly detection models are built based on SVDD algorithm, which utilizes normal data samples to construct a hypersphere for each cluster. Finally, the anomalous behavior is identified via judging whether the target data falls outside the hypersphere.

It has many practical applications, including detecting long-term stealthy network activities in the background of normal-user activities, such as stealthy DDoS attack, stealthy network scan, or faked network trend, which cannot be detected by traditional flow cardinality measurement. With big network data, one challenge is to measure the persistent spreads of a massive number of flows without incurring too much memory overhead as such measurement may be performed at the line speed by network processors with fast but small on-chip memory. We propose a highly compact Virtual Intersection HyperLogLog (VI-HLL) architecture for this purpose.

221,"Tracing attack packets to their sources, known as IP traceback, is an important step to counter distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks. In this paper, we propose a novel packet logging based (i.e., hash-based) traceback scheme that requires an order of magnitude smaller processing and storage cost than the hash-based scheme proposed by Snoeren et al. [1], thereby being able to scalable to much higher link speed (e.g., OC-768). The base-line idea of our approach is to sample and log a small percentage (e.g., 3.3%) of packets. The challenge of this low sampling rate is that much more sophisticated techniques need to be used for traceback. Our solution is to construct the attack tree using the correlation between the attack packets sampled by neighboring routers. The scheme using naive independent random sampling does not perform well due to the low correlation between the packets sampled by neighboring routers. We invent a sampling scheme that improves this correlation and the overall efficiency significantly. Another major contribution of this work is that we introduce a novel information-theoretic framework for our traceback scheme to answer important questions on system parameter tuning and the fundamental tradeoff between the resource used for traceback and the traceback accuracy. Simulation results based on real-world network topologies (e.g., Skitter) match very well with results from the information-theoretic analysis. The simulation results also demonstrate that our traceback scheme can achieve high accuracy, and scale very well to a large number of attackers (e.g., 5000+).",https://dl.acm.org/ft_gateway.cfm?id=1514018&ftid=602558&dwn=1&CFID=73804999&CFTOKEN=5ede92e20e41d14d-19D8B984-076C-E49D-F17D55E55ADB33F9,https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1514018&preflayout=flat,13,378,December 2008,Large-scale IP traceback in high-speed internet: practical techniques and information-theoretic foundation,"IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking (TON): Volume 16 Issue 6, December 2008"

However, with the explosive volume of network data and the fast transmission speed of network packets (in giga or even tera bps), it is a challenging task to measure the size of each network flow both accurately and memory-efficiently, using the size-limited SRAM memory of line card. Therefore, many sublinear space algorithms for processing data streams have been proposed, such as CountMin (CM), Count Sketch (CS) and Virtual Active Counters (VAC), which achieve extreme memory compactness by providing probabilistic guarantees on flow size measurement accuracy. However, these existing algorithms can still be greatly improved as to the performance of both online recording and querying the per-flow size, which is needed for online tracking heavy hitters.

230,"As today's networks become larger and more complex, the Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) flooding attack threats may not only come from the outside of networks but also from inside, such as cloud computing network where exists multiple tenants possibly containing malicious tenants. So, the need of source-based defense mechanism against such attacks is pressing. In this paper, we mainly focus on the source-based defense mechanism against Botnet-based DDoS flooding attack through combining the power of Software-Defined Networking (SDN) and sample flow (sFlow) technology. Firstly, we defined a metric to measure the essential features of this kind attack which means distribution and collaboration. Then we designed a simple detection algorithm based on statistical inference model and response scheme through the abilities of SDN. Finally, we developed an application to realize our idea and also tested its effect on emulation network with real network traffic. The result shows that our mechanism could effectively detect DDoS flooding attack originated in SDN environment and identify attack flows for avoiding the harm of attack spreading to target or outside. We advocate the advantages of SDN in the area of defending DDoS attacks, because it is difficult and laborious to organize selfish and undisciplined traditional distributed network to confront well collaborative DDoS flooding attacks.",https://dl.acm.org/ft_gateway.cfm?id=2935674&ftid=1741548&dwn=1&CFID=73804999&CFTOKEN=5ede92e20e41d14d-19D8B984-076C-E49D-F17D55E55ADB33F9,https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2935674&preflayout=flat,0,462,June 2016,An Easy Defense Mechanism Against Botnet-based DDoS Flooding Attack Originated in SDN Environment Using sFlow,CFI '16: Proceedings of the 11th International Conference on Future Internet Technologies

From the 4-layer protocol stack architecture in the Internet, the TCP layer seems to be vulnerable to flooding attacks, like the notorious Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS), due to 3-way handshaking mechanism defined in the connection-oriented TCP layer. In wireless LAN, the assaulting patterns from TCP-based DDoS have the similar destructive patterns as that in the wired Internet. In this article, we propose a feasible approach to alleviate the impact caused by TCP SYN Flooding. With the effective dual-queue application, the proposed Second Chance Packet Filtering (SCPF) scheme can efficiently decrease the probability of accepting bad frames, under the condition of not bothering the legal frames as possible, and therefore counteract the TCP SYN Flooding to an acceptable level.

The attacker purpose is to guarantee the service unavailability and maximize the financial loss costs. As a result, Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks have appeared as the most popular attack. The main aim of such attacks is to saturate and overload the system network through a massive data packets size flooding toward a victim server and to block the service to users. This paper provides a defending system in order to mitigate the Denial of Service (DoS) attack in CDC environment. Basically it outlines the different techniques of DoS attacks and its countermeasures by combining the filtering and detection mechanisms. We presented an analytical model based on queueing model to evaluate the impact of flooding attack on cloud environment regarding service availability and QoS performance.

In this work, we focus on TCP-SYN flood based Distributed Denial of Services (DDoS) attacks. Light Weight Intrusion Detection System (LISYS) provides the basic framework for AIS based NID systems. AISs normally utilize the negative selection algorithm in thymus action to tolerize the detectors to normal traffic so they may not detect normal traffic as malicious traffic.

239,"In recent years, the botnet phenomenon is one of the most dangerous threat to Internet security, which supports a wide range of criminal activities, including distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks, click fraud, phishing, malware distribution, spam emails, etc. An increasing number of botnets use Domain Generation Algorithms (DGAs) to avoid detection and exclusion by the traditional methods. By dynamically and frequently generating a large number of random domain names for candidate command and control (C&C) server, botnet can be still survive even when a C&C server domain is identified and taken down. This paper presents a novel method to detect DGA botnets using Collaborative Filtering and Density-Based Clustering.

240,"While peer-to-peer (P2P) systems have emerged in popularity in recent years, their large-scale and complexity make them difficult to reason about. In this paper, we argue that systematic analysis of traffic characteristics of P2P systems can reveal a wealth of information about their behavior, and highlight potential undesirable activities that such systems may exhibit. As a first step to this end, we present an offline and semi-automated approach to detect undesirable behavior. Our analysis is applied on real traffic traces collected from a Point-of-Presence (PoP) of a national-wide ISP in which over 70% of the total traffic is due to eMule [19], a popular P2P file-sharing system. Flow-level measurements are aggregated into ""samples"" referring to the activity of each host during a time interval. We then employ a clustering technique to automatically and coarsely identify similar behavior across samples, and extensively use domain knowledge to interpret and analyze the resulting clusters. Our analysis shows several examples of undesirable behavior including evidence of DDoS attacks exploiting live P2P clients, significant amounts of unwanted traffic that may harm network performance, and instances where the performance of participating peers may be subverted due to maliciously deployed servers. Identification of such patterns can benefit network operators, P2P system developers, and actual end-users.",https://dl.acm.org/ft_gateway.cfm?id=1555353&ftid=643663&dwn=1&CFID=73804999&CFTOKEN=5ede92e20e41d14d-19D8B984-076C-E49D-F17D55E55ADB33F9,https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1555353&preflayout=flat,5,739,June 2009,Inferring undesirable behavior from P2P traffic analysis,SIGMETRICS '09: Proceedings of the eleventh international joint conference on Measurement and modeling of computer systems
241,"Volumetric attacks, which overwhelm the bandwidth of a destination, are amongst the most common DDoS attacks today. One practical approach to addressing these attacks is to redirect all destination traffic (e.g., via DNS or BGP) to a third-party, DDoS-protection-as-a-service provider (e.g., CloudFlare) that is well provisioned and equipped with filtering mechanisms to remove attack traffic before passing the remaining benign traffic to the destination. An alternative approach is based on the concept of network capabilities, whereby source sending rates are determined by receiver consent, in the form of capabilities enforced by the network. While both third-party scrubbing services and network capabilities can be effective at reducing unwanted traffic at an overwhelmed destination, DDoS-protection-as-a-service solutions outsource all of the scheduling decisions (e.g., fairness, priority and attack identification) to the provider, while capability-based solutions require extensive modifications to existing infrastructure to operate. In this paper we introduce MiddlePolice, which seeks to marry the deployability of DDoS-protection-as-a-service solutions with the destination-based control of network capability systems. We show that by allowing feedback from the destination to the provider, MiddlePolice can effectively enforce destination-chosen policies, while requiring no deployment from unrelated parties.",https://dl.acm.org/ft_gateway.cfm?id=2978306&ftid=1805764&dwn=1&CFID=73804999&CFTOKEN=5ede92e20e41d14d-19D8B984-076C-E49D-F17D55E55ADB33F9,https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2978306&preflayout=flat,3,585,October 2016,MiddlePolice: Toward Enforcing Destination-Defined Policies in the Middle of the Internet,CCS '16: Proceedings of the 2016 ACM SIGSAC Conference on Computer and Communications Security

The traditional transaction system of storage resources, which generally runs in a centralized mode, results in high cost, vendor lock-in, single point failure risk, DDoS attack and information security. Therefore, this paper proposes a distributed transaction method for cloud storage based on smart contract. First, to guarantee the fault tolerance and decrease the storing cost for erasure coding, a VCG-based auction mechanism is proposed for storage transaction, and we deploy and implement the proposed mechanism by designing a corresponding smart contract. Especially, we address the problem - how to implement a VCG-like mechanism in a blockchain environment.

245,"There is a growing interest in discovery of internet topology at the interface level. A new generation of highly distributed measurement systems is currently being deployed. Unfortunately, the research community has not examined the problem of how to perform such measurements efficiently and in a network-friendly manner. In this paper we make two contributions toward that end. First, we show that standard topology discovery methods (e.g., skitter) are quite inefficient, repeatedly probing the same interfaces. This is a concern, because when scaled up, such methods will generate so much traffic that they will begin to resemble DDoS attacks. We measure two kinds of redundancy in probing (intra- and inter-monitor) and show that both kinds are important. We show that straightforward approaches to addressing these two kinds of redundancy must take opposite tacks, and are thus fundamentally in conflict. Our second contribution is to propose and evaluate Doubletree, an algorithm that reduces both types of redundancy simultaneously on routers and end systems. The key ideas are to exploit the tree-like structure of routes to and from a single point in order to guide when to stop probing, and to probe each path by starting near its midpoint. Our results show that Doubletree can reduce both types of measurement load on the network dramatically, while permitting discovery of nearly the same set of nodes and links.",https://dl.acm.org/ft_gateway.cfm?id=1064256&ftid=315381&dwn=1&CFID=73804999&CFTOKEN=5ede92e20e41d14d-19D8B984-076C-E49D-F17D55E55ADB33F9,https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1064256&preflayout=flat,39,983,June 2005,Efficient algorithms for large-scale topology discovery,SIGMETRICS '05: Proceedings of the 2005 ACM SIGMETRICS international conference on Measurement and modeling of computer systems
246,"Countering distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks is becoming ever more challenging with the vast resources and techniques increasingly available to attackers. In this paper, we consider sophisticated attacks that are protocol-compliant, non-intrusive, and utilize legitimate application-layer requests to overwhelm system resources. We characterize application-layer resource attacks as either request flooding, asymmetric, or repeated one-shot, on the basis of the application workload parameters that they exploit. To protect servers from these attacks, we propose a counter-mechanism namely DDoS Shield that consists of a suspicion assignment mechanism and a DDoS-resilient scheduler. In contrast to prior work, our suspicion mechanism assigns a continuous value as opposed to a binary measure to each client session, and the scheduler utilizes these values to determine if and when to schedule a session's requests. Using testbed experiments on a web application, we demonstrate the potency of these resource attacks and evaluate the efficacy of our counter-mechanism. For instance, we mount an asymmetric attack which overwhelms the server resources, increasing the response time of legitimate clients from 0.3 seconds to 40 seconds. Under the same attack scenario, DDoS Shield improves the victims' performance to 1.5 seconds.",https://dl.acm.org/ft_gateway.cfm?id=1514073&ftid=602595&dwn=1&CFID=73804999&CFTOKEN=5ede92e20e41d14d-19D8B984-076C-E49D-F17D55E55ADB33F9,https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1514073&preflayout=flat,19,"1,177",February 2009,DDoS-shield: DDoS-resilient scheduling to counter application layer attacks,"IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking (TON): Volume 17 Issue 1, February 2009"

Little attention has been paid to the external threat sources that have the capability to affect the financial viability, hence the long-term availability, of services hosted in the public cloud. Similar to an application-layer DDoS attack, a Fraudulent Resource Consumption (FRC) attack is a much more subtle attack carried out over a longer duration of time. The objective of the attacker is to exploit the utility pricing model which governs the resource usage in the cloud model by fraudulently consuming web content with the purpose of depriving the victim of their long-term economic availability of hosting publicly accessible web content in the cloud. In this paper, we thoroughly describe the FRC attack and discuss why current application-layer DDoS detection schemes are not applicable to a more subtle attack.

It has many practical applications, including detecting long-term stealthy network activities in the background of normal-user activities, such as stealthy DDoS attack, stealthy network scan, or faked network trend, which cannot be detected by traditional flow cardinality measurement. With big network data, one challenge is to measure the persistent spreads of a massive number of flows without incurring too much memory overhead as such measurement may be performed at the line speed by network processors with fast but small on-chip memory. We propose a highly compact Virtual Intersection HyperLogLog (VI-HLL) architecture for this purpose. It achieves far better memory efficiency than the best prior work of V-Bitmap, and in the meantime drastically extends the measurement range. Theoretical analysis and extensive experiments demonstrate that VI-HLL provides good measurement accuracy even in very tight memory space of less than 1 bit per flow.",https://dl.acm.org/ft_gateway.cfm?id=3078593&ftid=1879606&dwn=1&CFID=73804999&CFTOKEN=5ede92e20e41d14d-19D8B984-076C-E49D-F17D55E55ADB33F9,https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3078593&preflayout=flat,0,98,June 2017,Persistent Spread Measurement for Big Network Data Based on Register Intersection,SIGMETRICS '17 Abstracts: Proceedings of the 2017 ACM SIGMETRICS / International Conference on Measurement and Modeling of Computer Systems
250,"Much of today's distributed computing takes place in a client /server model. Despite advances in fault tolerance - in particular, replication and load distribution -- server overload remains to be a major problem. In the Web context, one of the main overload factors is the direct consequence of expensive Public Key operations performed by servers as part of each SSL handshake. Since most SSL-enabled servers use RSA, the burden of performing many costly decryption operations can be very detrimental to server performance. This paper examines a promising technique for re-balancing RSA-based client/server handshakes. This technique facilitates more favorable load distribution by requiring clients to perform more work (as part of encryption) and servers to perform commensurately less work, thus resulting in better SSL throughput. Proposed techniques are based on careful adaptation of variants of ",https://dl.acm.org/ft_gateway.cfm?id=1128826&ftid=359683&dwn=1&CFID=73804999&CFTOKEN=5ede92e20e41d14d-19D8B984-076C-E49D-F17D55E55ADB33F9,https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1128826&preflayout=flat,11,"1,245",March 2006,Improving secure server performance by re-balancing SSL/TLS handshakes,"ASIACCS '06: Proceedings of the 2006 ACM Symposium on Information, computer and communications security"

253,"Denial of service (DoS)/Distributed DoS (DDoS) attack is an eminent threat to an authentication server, which is used to guard access to firewalls, virtual private networks and wired/wireless networks. The major problem is that an authentication server needs to verify whether a request is from a legitimate user and if intensive computation and/or memory resources are needed for verifying a request, then DoS/DDoS attack is feasible. In this paper, a new protocol called Identity-Based Privacy-Protected Access Control Filter (IPACF) is proposed to counter DoS/DDoS attack. This protocol is an improvement of IDF (Identity-Based Dynamic Access Control Filter). The proposed protocol is stateless because it does not create a state for an authentication request unless the request is from a legitimate user. Moreover, the IPACF is stateless for both user and authentication server since a user and responder authenticate each other. A filter value, which is generated by pre-shared secrets, is sent in a frame and checked to see if the request is legitimate. Note that the process of checking filter value is not intensive computation. The filter value is tabulated in a table with user identity so that a filter value represents a user's identity and only the legitimate user and authentication server can figure out the identity. When a filter value is from a legitimate source, a new filter value will be generated for the next frame. Consequently, the filter value is changed for every frame. Thus the privacy of both user and server are protected.",https://dl.acm.org/ft_gateway.cfm?id=1404806&ftid=525496&dwn=1&CFID=73804999&CFTOKEN=5ede92e20e41d14d-19D8B984-076C-E49D-F17D55E55ADB33F9,https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1404806&preflayout=flat,3,291,March 2007,Using Identity-Based Privacy-Protected Access Control Filter (IPACF) to against denial of service attacks and protect user privacy,SpringSim '07: Proceedings of the 2007 spring simulation multiconference - Volume 3

258,"Denial-of-service (DoS) attacks significantly degrade service quality experienced by legitimate users, by introducing large delays, excessive losses, and service interruptions. The main goal of DoS defenses is to neutralize this effect, and to quickly and fully restore quality of various services to levels acceptable by the users. To objectively evaluate a variety of proposed defenses we must be able to precisely measure damage created by an attack, i.e., the denial of service itself, in controlled testbed experiments. Current evaluation methodologies measure DoS damage superficially and partially by measuring a single traffic parameter, such as duration, loss or throughput, and showing divergence during the attack from the baseline case. These measures do not consider quality-of-service requirements of different applications and how they map into specific thresholds for various traffic parameters. They thus fail to measure the service quality experienced by the end users.We propose a series of DoS impact metrics that are derived from traffic traces gathered at the source and the destination networks.

263,"Multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) technologies are popular in emerging wireless systems. Optimal MIMO communication is achieved by applying a waterfilling solution over the parallel subchannels associated with the channel matrix between a transmitter and receiver. The viability of such a method relies on the transmitter and receiver performing the singular value decomposition (SVD) of the estimated channel matrix. The estimation and use of the estimated channel matrix, however, is a point of weakness that can be used to subvert MIMO communication. In this paper, we investigate strategies for disrupting MIMO communications by developing attacks that target the channel estimation procedure of a MIMO system. Specifically, we study the impact that jamming the channel estimation procedure can have on SVD-based MIMO systems. Further, most new standards that employ MIMO incorporate space-time block coding (STBC) to bolster throughput and reliability.

Unfortunately, all the IDS systems we know of keep per-connection or per-flow state. Thus it is hardly surprising that IDS systems (other than signature detection mechanisms) have not scaled to multi-gigabit speeds. By contrast, note that both router lookups and fair queuing have scaled to high speeds using <i>aggregation</i> via prefix lookups or DiffServ. Thus in this paper, we initiate research into the question as to whether one can detect attacks without keeping per-flow state. We will show that such aggregation, while making fast implementations possible, immediately cause two problems. First, aggregation can cause <i>behavioral</i> aliasing where, for example, good behaviors can aggregate to look like bad behaviors. Second, aggregated schemes are susceptible to spoofing by which the intruder sends attacks that have appropriate aggregate behavior. We examine a wide variety of DoS attacks and show that several categories (bandwidth based, claim-and-hold, host scanning) can be scalably detected. By contrast, it appears that stealthy port-scanning cannot be scalably detected without keeping per-flow state.",https://dl.acm.org/ft_gateway.cfm?id=1028812&ftid=283942&dwn=1&CFID=73804999&CFTOKEN=5ede92e20e41d14d-19D8B984-076C-E49D-F17D55E55ADB33F9,https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1028812&preflayout=flat,23,"1,916",October 2004,On scalable attack detection in the network,IMC '04: Proceedings of the 4th ACM SIGCOMM conference on Internet measurement

We analyze all the known decompression quines by studying their structures, and their impact on anti-viruses. Our analysis reveals that most of the anti-viruses do not have a suitable architecture in place to detect decompression quines.

279,"Wireless networks are built upon a shared medium that makes it easy for adversaries to launch jamming-style attacks. These attacks can be easily accomplished by an adversary emitting radio frequency signals that do not follow an underlying MAC protocol. Jamming attacks can severely interfere with the normal operation of wireless networks and, consequently, mechanisms are needed that can cope with jamming attacks. In this paper, we examine radio interference attacks from both sides of the issue: first, we study the problem of conducting radio interference attacks on wireless networks, and second we examine the critical issue of diagnosing the presence of jamming attacks. Specifically, we propose four different jamming attack models that can be used by an adversary to disable the operation of a wireless network, and evaluate their effectiveness in terms of how each method affects the ability of a wireless node to send and receive packets. We then discuss different measurements that serve as the basis for detecting a jamming attack, and explore scenarios where each measurement by itself is not enough to reliably classify the presence of a jamming attack. In particular, we observe that signal strength and carrier sensing time are unable to conclusively detect the presence of a jammer. Further, we observe that although by using packet delivery ratio we may differentiate between congested and jammed scenarios, we are nonetheless unable to conclude whether poor link utility is due to jamming or the mobility of nodes. The fact that no single measurement is sufficient for reliably classifying the presence of a jammer is an important observation, and necessitates the development of enhanced detection schemes that can remove ambiguity when detecting a jammer. To address this need, we propose two enhanced detection protocols that employ consistency checking. The first scheme employs signal strength measurements as a reactive consistency check for poor packet delivery ratios, while the second scheme employs location information to serve as the consistency check. Throughout our discussions, we examine the feasibility and effectiveness of jamming attacks and detection schemes using the MICA2 Mote platform.",https://dl.acm.org/ft_gateway.cfm?id=1062697&ftid=317645&dwn=1&CFID=73804999&CFTOKEN=5ede92e20e41d14d-19D8B984-076C-E49D-F17D55E55ADB33F9,https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1062697&preflayout=flat,175,"3,366",May 2005,The feasibility of launching and detecting jamming attacks in wireless networks,MobiHoc '05: Proceedings of the 6th ACM international symposium on Mobile ad hoc networking and computing

Our evaluation shows that StopIt can block the attack traffic from a few millions of attackers within tens of minutes with bounded router memory. We compare StopIt with existing filter-based and capability-based DoS defense systems under simulated DoS attacks of various types and scales. Our results show that StopIt outperforms existing filter-based systems, and can prevent legitimate communications from being disrupted by various DoS flooding attacks. It also outperforms capability-based systems in most attack scenarios, but a capability-based system is more effective in a type of attack that the attack traffic does not reach a victim, but congests a link shared by the victim.

To avoid the problems in existing methods, we propose a novel approach against reactive jamming attacks by identifying the trigger nodes, whose transmissions activate any reactive jammers. The identification of these trigger nodes can help us (i) carefully design a better routing protocol by switching these nodes into only receivers to avoid activating jammers and (ii) locate the jammers based on the trigger nodes, thus providing an alternative mechanism against reactive jamming attacks. In this paper, we provide an efficient method to identify the trigger nodes by utilizing the group testing techniques and minimum collection of disjoint disk covers to reduce the message and computational overhead.

296,"This paper focuses on ""router-based"" defense mechanisms, and whether they can provide effective solutions to network Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks. Router-based defenses operate either on traffic aggregates or on individual flows, and have been shown, either alone or in combination with other schemes, e.g., traceback, to be reasonably effective against certain types of basic attacks. Those attacks are, however, relatively brute-force, and usually accompanied by either significant increases in congestion, and/or traffic patterns that are easily identified. It is, therefore, unclear if router-based solutions are viable in the presence of more diverse or sophisticated attacks. As a result, even if incorporating defense mechanisms in the routers themselves has obvious advantages, such schemes have not seen wide deployments. Our ultimate goal is to determine whether it is possible to build router-based defense mechanisms that are effective against a wide range of attacks. This paper describes a first phase of this effort aimed at identifying weaknesses in existing systems. In particular, the paper demonstrates that aggregate defense systems can be readily circumvented, even by a single attacker, through minor modifications of its flooding patterns. Flow-based defenses fare slightly better, but can still be easily fooled by a small number of attackers generating transient flooding patterns. The findings of the paper provide insight into possible approaches for designing better and more robust router-based defense systems.",https://dl.acm.org/ft_gateway.cfm?id=1070878&ftid=312671&dwn=1&CFID=73804999&CFTOKEN=5ede92e20e41d14d-19D8B984-076C-E49D-F17D55E55ADB33F9,https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1070878&preflayout=flat,6,"1,037",July 2005,On the robustness of router-based denial-of-service (DoS) defense systems,"ACM SIGCOMM Computer Communication Review: Volume 35 Issue 3, July 2005"

306,"This paper considers DoS attacks on DNS wherein attackers flood the nameservers of a zone to disrupt resolution of resource records belonging to the zone and consequently, any of its sub-zones. We propose a minor change in the caching behavior of DNS resolvers that can significantly alleviate the impact of such attacks. In our proposal, DNS resolvers do not completely evict cached resource records whose TTL has expired; rather, such resource records are stored in a separate ""stale cache"". If, during the resolution of a query, a resolver does not receive any response from the nameservers that are responsible for authoritatively answering the query, it can use the information stored in the stale cache to answer the query. In effect, the stale cache is the part of the global DNS database that has been accessed by the resolver and represents an insurance policy that the resolver uses only when the relevant DNS servers are unavailable. We analyze a 65-day DNS trace to quantify the benefits of a stale cache under different attack scenarios. Further, while the proposed change to DNS resolvers also changes DNS semantics, we argue that it does not adversely impact any of the fundamental DNS characteristics such as the autonomy of zone operators and hence, is a very simple and practical candidate for mitigating the impact of DoS attacks on DNS.",https://dl.acm.org/ft_gateway.cfm?id=1455796&ftid=576373&dwn=1&CFID=73804999&CFTOKEN=5ede92e20e41d14d-19D8B984-076C-E49D-F17D55E55ADB33F9,https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1455796&preflayout=flat,4,"1,233",October 2008,Mitigating DNS DoS attacks,CCS '08: Proceedings of the 15th ACM conference on Computer and communications security
307,"The Android OS not only dominates 78.6% of the worldwide smartphone market in 2014, but importantly has been widely used for mission critical tasks (e.g., medical devices, auto/aircraft navigators, embedded in satellite project). The core of Android, System Server (SS), is a multi-threaded process that contains most of the system services and provides the essential functionalities to support applications (apps). Considering the complicated design of the SS and its easily-accessible system services (e.g., via Android APIs), we conjecture that the SS may face DoS attacks. As the SS plays the important role in Android, serious DoS attacks could cause single-point-of-failure to the phone system. By studying the source code, we discovered a general design trait in the concurrency control mechanism of the SS that could be vulnerable to DoS attacks. To validate our hypothesis, we design a tool to cost efficiently explore high-risk methods in the SS. After a systematic analysis of 2,154 candidate-risky methods, we found four unknown vulnerabilities in critical services (e.g., the ActivityManager and the WindowManager), which are named the Android Stroke Vulnerabilities ({\it ASVs}). Exploiting the ASVs would continuously block all other requests for system services, followed by killing the SS and soft-rebooting the OS. Results of a further threat analysis show that by writing a loop to invoke Android APIs in an app, an attacker can continually freeze (reboot) the device at targeted critical moments (e.g., when patching vulnerable apps). Furthermore, ASVs can be exploited to enhance malware with anti-removal capability or to design the ransomware by putting the devices into continuous DoS loops. After being informed, Google confirmed our findings promptly. We also proposed to their Android framework team several improvements in their concurrency control design and a fine-grained failure recovery mechanism for the SS.",https://dl.acm.org/ft_gateway.cfm?id=2813606&ftid=1630965&dwn=1&CFID=73804999&CFTOKEN=5ede92e20e41d14d-19D8B984-076C-E49D-F17D55E55ADB33F9,https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2813606&preflayout=flat,16,"1,184",October 2015,From System Services Freezing to System Server Shutdown in Android: All You Need Is a Loop in an App,CCS '15: Proceedings of the 22nd ACM SIGSAC Conference on Computer and Communications Security

319,"Recent work shows that an adversary can exploit a coupling effect induced by hidden nodes to launch a cascading attack causing global congestion in a Wi-Fi network. The underlying assumption is that the power of interference caused by a hidden node is an order of magnitude stronger than the signal sent to the receiver. In this paper, we investigate the feasibility of cascading attacks with weakly interfering hidden nodes, that is when the signal-to-interference ratio is high. Through extensive ns-3 simulations, including for an indoor building model, we show that cascading attacks are still feasible. The attacks leverage two PHY-layer phenomena: receiver capture and bit rate adaptation. We show that the attack relies on a coupling effect, whereby the average bit rate of a transmission pair drops sharply as the channel utilization of a neighboring pair gets higher. This coupling effect facilitates the propagation of the attack throughout the network.",https://dl.acm.org/ft_gateway.cfm?id=3242142&ftid=2012329&dwn=1&CFID=73804999&CFTOKEN=5ede92e20e41d14d-19D8B984-076C-E49D-F17D55E55ADB33F9,https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3242142&preflayout=flat,0,39,October 2018,Cascading Attacks on Wi-Fi Networks with Weak Interferers,"MSWIM '18: Proceedings of the 21st ACM International Conference on Modeling, Analysis and Simulation of Wireless and Mobile Systems"

321,"Denial of service (DoS) attacks continue to threaten the reliability of networking systems. Previous approaches for protecting networks from DoS attacks are reactive in that they wait for an attack to be launched before taking appropriate measures to protect the network. This leaves the door open for other attacks that use more sophisticated methods to mask their traffic.We propose an architecture called Secure Overlay Services (SOS) that proactively prevents DoS attacks, geared toward supporting Emergency Services or similar types of communication. The architecture is constructed using a combination of secure overlay tunneling, routing via consistent hashing, and filtering. We reduce the probability of successful attacks by (i) performing intensive filtering near protected network edges, pushing the attack point perimeter into the core of the network, where high-speed routers can handle the volume of attack traffic, and (ii) introducing randomness and anonymity into the architecture, making it difficult for an attacker to target nodes along the path to a specific SOS-protected destination.Using simple analytical models, we evaluate the likelihood that an attacker can successfully launch a DoS attack against an SOS-protected network.

In this paper, we propose a first analytic pipeline that enables us to cluster and characterize attack campaigns into several main profiles that exhibit similarities. These similarities are due to common technical properties of the underlying infrastructures used to launch these attacks. Although we do not have access to the ground truth and we do not know how many perpetrators are acting behind the scene, we can group their attacks based on relevant commonalities with cluster ensembling to estimate their number and capture their profiles over time. Specifically, our results show that we can repeatably identify and group together common profiles of attacks while considering domain expert's constraint in the cluster ensembles. From the obtained consensus clusters, we can generate comprehensive rules that characterize past campaigns and that can be used for classifying the next ones despite the evolving nature of the attacks.

323,"A typical wireless sensor node has little protection against radio jamming. The situation becomes worse if energy-efficient jamming can be achieved by exploiting knowledge of the data link layer. Encrypting the packets may help prevent the jammer from taking actions based on the content of the packets, but the temporal arrangement of the packets induced by the nature of the protocol might unravel patterns that the jammer can take advantage of even when the packets are encrypted. By looking at the packet interarrival times in three representative MAC protocols, S-MAC, LMAC and B-MAC, we derive several jamming attacks that allow the jammer to jam S-MAC, LMAC and B-MAC energy-efficiently. The jamming attacks are based on realistic assumptions. The algorithms are described in detail and simulated. The effectiveness and efficiency of the attacks are examined. Careful analysis of other protocols belonging to the respective categories of S-MAC, LMAC and B-MAC reveal that those protocols are, to some extent, also susceptible to our attacks.

With 10 different network traffic conditions, network bursts and HTTP-delay traffic as traffic sources, five different overlay topologies, and latency and loss rate as QoS constraints, we noted that even under network attacks, QoSMap constructed overlays were able to meet applications requirements overlays of high QoS and long lifetime.

With 38.9% of market share, Android is now the most used operating system not just in terms of mobile devices but considering all OSes. As applications' complexity and features increased, Android relied more heavily on code and data sharing among apps for faster response times and richer user experience. To achieve that, Android apps reuse functionality and data by means of inter-app message passing where each app defines the messages it expects to receive. In this paper, we analyze the proliferation of exploitable inter-app communication vulnerabilities using a rich corpus of 1) a representative sample of 32 Android devices, 2) 59 official Google Android versions, and 3) the top 18,583 apps from 2016 to 2017. This corpus covers $91$ Android builds from version 4.4 to present. To the best of our knowledge, ours is the first longitudinal study looking into the propagation of vulnerabilities across AOSP builds, between AOSP and a diverse set of devices, and across app versions over a period of 13 months. To identify inter-app vulnerabilities, we developed Daze as a swift and fully-automated framework for extracting app components and fuzzing all app interfaces. Daze needs only about three hours for full-device analysis or two minutes per app on average. We identified 14,413 vulnerabilities and quantified their exposure time and the number of versions affected. Our findings revealed that $51.7%$ of Android devices and $49%$ of the top $300$ apps on Google Play contained at least one critical inter-app vulnerability. We found that about $15%$ of fixed vulnerabilities lived for more than $100$ days before being patched, more than $20%$ of unpatched vulnerabilities have existed for at least $180$ days, and $45%$ of unpatched vulnerabilities persisted through the latest two to four consecutive app versions in our dataset.",https://dl.acm.org/ft_gateway.cfm?id=3196549&ftid=1977518&dwn=1&CFID=73804999&CFTOKEN=5ede92e20e41d14d-19D8B984-076C-E49D-F17D55E55ADB33F9,https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3196549&preflayout=flat,0,140,May 2018,Dazed Droids: A Longitudinal Study of Android Inter-App Vulnerabilities,ASIACCS '18: Proceedings of the 2018 on Asia Conference on Computer and Communications Security

We show that common design flaws in these schemes lead to highly effective attacks against the anonymity provided by the schemes. These attacks stem from attacks on DHT routing, and are not mitigated by the well-known DHT security mechanisms due to a fundamental mismatch between the security requirements of DHT routing's put/get functionality and anonymous routing's relay selection functionality. Our attacks essentially allow an adversary that controls only a small fraction of the relays to function as a global active adversary. We apply these attacks in more detail to two schemes: Salsa and Cashmere. In the case of Salsa, we show that an attacker that controls 10% of the relays in a network of size 10,000 can compromise more than 80% of all completed circuits; and in the case of Cashmere, we show that an attacker that controls 20% of the relays in a network of size 64000 can compromise 42% of the circuits.",https://dl.acm.org/ft_gateway.cfm?id=1655199&ftid=699524&dwn=1&CFID=73804999&CFTOKEN=5ede92e20e41d14d-19D8B984-076C-E49D-F17D55E55ADB33F9,https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1655199&preflayout=flat,6,246,November 2009,Hashing it out in public: common failure modes of DHT-based anonymity schemes,WPES '09: Proceedings of the 8th ACM workshop on Privacy in the electronic society
353,"In this work we focus on resource depletion attacks within IEEE 802.11 networks. This type of DoS attacks is used to exhaust access points' resources resulting in denying service to legitimate clients and rising the opportunity for more sophisticated attacks. It is usually based on flooding an access point (AP) with a high number of fake authentication requests. This paper introduces a protection method which assists APs to selectively block fake requests sent by an attacker, while at the same time allowing other legitimate clients to successfully join the network. For this purpose we introduce the concept of regions, estimates on client's relative locations. The concept itself is similar to a known protection against DoS attacks based on client puzzles in wired networks, yet had to be adjusted to the peculiarities of wireless networks. Rather than utilizing CPU or memory-based resources that are highly variable among wireless clients we take advantage of wireless characteristics such as broadcast communication, signal propagation, and dense deployment of IEEE 802.11 technology.

In the future, All-IP networks will substitute the classical Public Switched Telephone Networks (PSTNs). Nowadays, there is no All-IP network yet, but many VoIP-providers already enable calls from VoIP to a PSTN and vice versa. Thus, critical infrastructures within the PSTN like the emergency call service, are accessible from the VoIP network (e.g. the Internet) and get exposed to new security threats. In particular, there is the risk of Denial of Service (DoS) attacks originating from the VoIP network. An attacker could jam the emergency call service by generating a massive load of faked emergency calls, which could lead to the loss of lives in the worst case. For us, this was the motivation to analyse the applicability of the concept of Intrusion Detection (ID) in the emergency call context and develop an adapted ID-architecture including its implementation.

356,"Real-time Anomaly Detection Systems (ADSs) use packet sampling to realize traffic analysis at wire speeds. While recent studies have shown that a considerable loss of anomaly detection accuracy is incurred due to sampling, solutions to mitigate this loss are largely unexplored. In this paper, we propose a Progressive Security-Aware Packet Sampling (PSAS) algorithm which enables a real-time inline anomaly detector to achieve higher accuracy by sampling larger volumes of malicious traffic than random sampling, while adhering to a given sampling budget. High malicious sampling rates are achieved by deploying inline ADSs progressively on a packet's path. Each ADS encodes a binary score (malicious or benign) of a sampled packet into the packet before forwarding it to the next hop node. The next hop node then samples packets marked as malicious with a higher probability. We analytically prove that under certain realistic conditions, irrespective of the intrusion detection algorithm used to formulate the packet score, PSAS always provides higher malicious packet sampling rates. To empirically evaluate the proposed PSAS algorithm, we simultaneously collect an Internet traffic dataset containing DoS and portscan attacks at three different deployment points in our university's network. Experimental results using four existing anomaly detectors show that PSAS, while having no extra communication overhead and extremely low complexity, allows these detectors to achieve significantly higher accuracies than those operating on random packet samples.",https://dl.acm.org/ft_gateway.cfm?id=1823846&ftid=810388&dwn=1&CFID=73804999&CFTOKEN=5ede92e20e41d14d-19D8B984-076C-E49D-F17D55E55ADB33F9,https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1823846&preflayout=flat,10,423,June 2010,On mitigating sampling-induced accuracy loss in traffic anomaly detection systems,"ACM SIGCOMM Computer Communication Review: Volume 40 Issue 3, July 2010"

Like most external attributes, attackability is to some extent disconnected from the internal of software products. To improve the quality of software products we need to be able to affect its internal features. So, for attackability measures to be useful for software products enhancement, we need to identify related internal software attributes. We study in this paper the empirical relationship between attackability as an external software quality attribute with coupling as an internal software attribute.

Especially, session key establishment schemes for IEEE 802.15.4 security are susceptible to denial-of-sleep attacks since injected requests for session key establishment typically trigger energy-consuming processing and communication. Nevertheless, Krentz et al.'s Adaptive Key Establishment Scheme (AKES) for IEEE 802.15.4 security is deemed to be resilient to denial-of-sleep attacks thanks to its energy-efficient design and special defenses. However, thus far, AKES' resilience to denial-of-sleep attacks was presumably never evaluated. In this paper, we make two contributions. First, we evaluate AKES' resilience to denial-of-sleep attacks both theoretically and empirically. We particularly consider two kinds of denial-of-sleep attacks, namely HELLO flood attacks, as well as what we introduce in this paper as ""yo-yo attacks"". Our key finding is that AKES' denial-of-sleep defenses require trade-offs between denial-of-sleep resilience and the speed at which AKES adapts to topology changes. Second, to alleviate these trade-offs, we devise and evaluate new denial-of-sleep defenses.

365,"The MAC standard amendment IEEE 802.15.4e is designed to meet the requirements of industrial and critical applications. In particular, the Time Slotted Channel Hopping (TSCH) mode divides time into periodic, equally sized, slotframes composed of transmission timeslots. Then, it combines time slotted access with multichannel and channel hopping capabilities, providing large network capacity, high reliability, and predictable latency while ensuring energy efficiency. Since every network node considers the same timeslots at each slotframe and selects physical channels according to a periodic function, TSCH produces a steady channel utilization pattern. This can be exploited by a selective jammer to entirely thwart communications of a victim node in a way that is stealthy, effective, and extremely energy efficient. This article shows how a selective jamming attack can be successfully performed even though TSCH uses the IEEE 802.15.4e security services. Furthermore, we propose DISH, a countermeasure which randomly permutes the timeslot and channel utilization patterns at every slotframe in a consistent and completely distributed way without requiring any additional message exchange.

369,The paper studies two types of events that often overload Web sites to a point when their services are degraded or disrupted entirely - flash events (FEs) and denial of service attacks (DoS). The former are created by legitimate requests and the latter contain malicious requests whose goal is to subvert the normal operation of the site. We study the properties of both types of events with a special attention to characteristics that distinguish the two. Identifying these characteristics allows a formulation of a strategy for Web sites to quickly discard malicious requests. We also show that some content distribution networks (CDNs) may not provide the desired level of protection to Web sites against flash events. We therefore propose an enhancement to CDNs that offers better protection and use trace-driven simulations to study the effect of our enhancement on CDNs and Web sites.,https://dl.acm.org/ft_gateway.cfm?id=511485&ftid=70829&dwn=1&CFID=73804999&CFTOKEN=5ede92e20e41d14d-19D8B984-076C-E49D-F17D55E55ADB33F9,https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=511485&preflayout=flat,165,"1,932",May 2002,Flash crowds and denial of service attacks: characterization and implications for CDNs and web sites,WWW '02: Proceedings of the 11th international conference on World Wide Web
370,"With the exponential growth of automotive security research, new security vulnerabilities and attacks have been revealed and new challenges have emerged. In recent years, various attacks ranging from replay attacks, through false information injection, to Denial of Service (DoS), have shown how fragile automotive security is. As a result, a number of security solutions have been proposed that rely on techniques like encryption and firewalls. However, most proposals require performance and computational overheads that would become an additional burden rather than a solution. In this paper, we propose a new automotive network algorithm, called ID-Hopping, that aims to prevent targeted DoS attacks in which attackers target certain functions by injecting special frames that would prevent a car's normal operations. We aim to raise the bar for attackers by randomizing the expected patterns in the automotive network. Such randomization hinders the attacker's ability to launch targeted DoS attacks. We built a testing platform and implemented the randomization mechanism to evaluate the algorithm's effectiveness. Based on the evaluation, the algorithm holds a promising solution for targeted DoS, and even reverse engineering, which automotive networks are most vulnerable to.",https://dl.acm.org/ft_gateway.cfm?id=3055382&ftid=1865888&dwn=1&CFID=73804999&CFTOKEN=5ede92e20e41d14d-19D8B984-076C-E49D-F17D55E55ADB33F9,https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3055382&preflayout=flat,0,185,April 2017,Using ID-Hopping to Defend Against Targeted DoS on CAN,SCAV'17: Proceedings of the 1st International Workshop on Safe Control of Connected and Autonomous Vehicles

372,"Large numbers of smart connected devices, also named as the Internet of Things (IoT), are permeating our environments (homes, factories, cars, and also our body - with wearable devices) to collect data and act on the insight derived. Ensuring software integrity (including OS, apps, and configurations) on such smart devices is then essential to guarantee both privacy and safety. A key mechanism to protect the software integrity of these devices is remote attestation: A process that allows a remote verifier to validate the integrity of the software of a device. This process usually makes use of a signed hash value of the actual device's software, generated by dedicated hardware. While individual device attestation is a well-established technique, to date integrity verification of a very large number of devices remains an open problem, due to scalability issues. In this paper, we present SANA, the first secure and scalable protocol for efficient attestation of large sets of devices that works under realistic assumptions. SANA relies on a novel signature scheme to allow anyone to publicly verify a collective attestation in constant time and space, for virtually an unlimited number of devices. We substantially improve existing swarm attestation schemes by supporting a realistic trust model where: (1) only the targeted devices are required to implement attestation; (2) compromising any device does not harm others; and (3) all aggregators can be untrusted. We implemented SANA and demonstrated its efficiency on tiny sensor devices. Furthermore, we simulated SANA at large scale, to assess its scalability. Our results show that SANA can provide efficient attestation of networks of 1,000,000 devices, in only 2.5 seconds.",https://dl.acm.org/ft_gateway.cfm?id=2978335&ftid=1805700&dwn=1&CFID=73804999&CFTOKEN=5ede92e20e41d14d-19D8B984-076C-E49D-F17D55E55ADB33F9,https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2978335&preflayout=flat,14,634,October 2016,SANA: Secure and Scalable Aggregate Network Attestation,CCS '16: Proceedings of the 2016 ACM SIGSAC Conference on Computer and Communications Security

376,"Current intrusion detection and prevention systems seek to detect a wide class of network intrusions (e.g., DoS attacks, worms, port scans) at network vantage points. Unfortunately, even today, many IDS systems we know of keep per-connection or per-flow state to detect malicious TCP flows. Thus, it is hardly surprising that these IDS systems have not scaled to multigigabit speeds. By contrast, both router lookups and fair queuing have scaled to high speeds using aggregation via prefix lookups or DiffServ. Thus, in this paper, we initiate research into the question as to whether one can detect attacks without keeping per-flow state. We will show that such aggregation, while making fast implementations possible, immediately causes two problems. First, aggregation can cause behavioral aliasing where, for example, good behaviors can aggregate to look like bad behaviors. Second, aggregated schemes are susceptible to spoofing by which the intruder sends attacks that have appropriate aggregate behavior. We examine a wide variety of DoS and scanning attacks and show that several categories (bandwidth based, claim-and-hold, port-scanning) can be scalably detected. In addition to existing approaches for scalable attack detection, we propose a novel data structure called partial completion filters (PCFs) that can detect claim-and-hold attacks scalably in the network. We analyze PCFs both analytically and using experiments on real network traces to demonstrate how we can tune PCFs to achieve extremely low false positive and false negative probabilities.",https://dl.acm.org/ft_gateway.cfm?id=1241834&ftid=412327&dwn=1&CFID=73804999&CFTOKEN=5ede92e20e41d14d-19D8B984-076C-E49D-F17D55E55ADB33F9,https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1241834&preflayout=flat,12,"1,377",February 2007,On scalable attack detection in the network,"IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking (TON): Volume 15 Issue 1, February 2007"

385,"Since IP packet reassembly requires resources, a denial of service attack can be mounted by swamping a receiver with IP fragments. In this paper we argue how this attack need not affect protocols that do not rely on IP fragmentation, and argue how most protocols, e.g., those that run on top of TCP, can avoid the need for fragmentation. However, protocols such as IPsec's IKE protocol, which both runs on top of UDP and requires sending large packets, depend on IP packet reassembly. Photuris, an early proposal for IKE, introduced the concept of a stateless cookie, intended for DoS protection. However, the stateless cookie mechanism cannot protect against a DoS attack unless the receiver can successfully receive the cookie, which it will not be able to do if reassembly resources are exhausted. Thus, without additional design and/or implementation defenses, an attacker can successfully, through a fragmentation attack, prevent legitimate IKE handshakes from completing. Defense against this attack requires both protocol design and implementation defenses. The IKEv2 protocol was designed to make it easy to design a defensive implementation. This paper explains the defense strategy designed into the IKEv2 protocol, along with the additional needed implementation mechanisms. It also describes and contrasts several other potential strategies that could work for similar UDP-based protocols.",https://dl.acm.org/ft_gateway.cfm?id=948113&ftid=239732&dwn=1&CFID=160953474&CFTOKEN=7c6f91dd74e9b503-1C0ABB46-9DE0-E00D-1937B1AAC1661724,https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=948113&preflayout=flat,7,"1,801",October 2003,DoS protection for UDP-based protocols,CCS '03: Proceedings of the 10th ACM conference on Computer and communications security
386,"In a bandwidth-flooding attack, compromised sources send high-volume traffic to the target with the purpose of causing congestion in its tail circuit and disrupting its legitimate communications. In this paper, we present Active Internet Traffic Filtering (AITF), a network-layer defense mechanism against such attacks. AITF enables a receiver to contact misbehaving sources and ask them to stop sending it traffic; each source that has been asked to stop is policed by its own Internet service provider (ISP), which ensures its compliance. An ISP that hosts misbehaving sources either supports AITF (and accepts to police its misbehaving clients), or risks losing all access to the complaining receiver--this is a strong incentive to cooperate, especially when the receiver is a popular public-access site. We show that AITF preserves a significant fraction of a receiver's bandwidth in the face of bandwidth flooding, and does so at a per-client cost that is already affordable for today's ISPs; this per-client cost is not expected to increase, as long as botnet-size growth does not outpace Moore's law. We also show that even the first two networks that deploy AITF can maintain their connectivity to each other in the face of bandwidth flooding.

392,"Embedded computing devices increasingly permeate many aspects of modern life: from medical to automotive, from building and factory automation to weapons, from avionics to home entertainment. Despite their specialized nature as well as limited resources and connectivity, these devices are becoming an increasingly popular and attractive target for remote malware infestation attacks, exemplified by Stuxnet [1]. Many mitigation techniques have been proposed, varying in terms of generality and underlying assumptions. One common theme is the need for Remote Attestation, a distinct security service that allows a trusted party (verifier) to check the internal state of a remote untrusted embedded device (prover). Purely software-based techniques, while efficient, offer dubious security guarantees. Most hardware-based techniques are too costly for low-end embedded devices.This talk focuses on three important challenges in designing Remote Attestation techniques for low-end embedded devices. First, what is the minimal set of hardware and software features for a low-end embedded device to attain provably secure remote attestation, under the strongest possible and realistic adversary model? Second, what mechanisms and features are needed to protect the remote attestation process from unauthorized invocation, i.e., how to assure that an embedded device is not being misused? Third, how to design efficient remote attestation for a multitude of potentially heterogeneous embedded devices, e.g., within a vehicle, a household, or an aircraft?

397,"Cloud computing introduces concerns about data protection and intrusion detection mechanism. A review of the literature shows that there is still a lack of works on cloud IDS that focused on implementing real-time hybrid detections using Dendritic Cell algorithm (DCA) as a practical approach. In addition, there is also lack of specific threat detection built to detect intrusions targeting cloud computing environment where current implementations still using traditional open source or enterprise IDS to detect threats targeting cloud computing environment. Cloud implementations also introduce a new term, ""co-residency"" attack and lack of research focusing on detecting this type of attack. This research aims to provide a hybrid intrusion detection model for Cloud computing environment. For this purpose, a modified DCA is proposed in this research as the main detection algorithm in the new hybrid intrusion detection mechanism which works on Cloud Co-Residency Threat Detection (CCTD) that combines anomaly and misuse detection mechanism. This research also proposed a method in detecting co-residency attacks. In this paper the co-residency attack detection model was proposed and tested until satisfactory results were obtained with the datasets. The experiment was conducted in a controlled environment and conducted using custom generated co-residency denial of service attacks for testing the capability of the proposed model in detecting novel co-residency attacks.

However, every botnet requires coordination. In order to initiate an attack, a botmaster must communicate to all of the bots in the network. In this paper, we present a steganographic system that demonstrates the feasibility of the social networking website Twitter as a botnet command and control center that an attacker could use to reliably communicate messages to a botnet with low latency and nearly perfect rate of transmission. Our system generates plausible cover messages based on a required tweet length determined by an encoding map that has been constructed based on the structure of the secret messages. The system considers both the input symbol frequencies (e.g. English letter frequencies) as well as the tweet length posting frequencies for constructing the encoding maps. A technique for automatically generating Twitter account names based on Markov chains is also presented so that the bots can connect to new accounts if the existing botmaster account is unavailable. All the experiments were performed using the 7.3M actual tweets from 3.7K verified accounts collected by the tweet parser developed by us. We have evaluated the efficacy of the system using Emulab and usability of the system through Amazon's Mechanical Turk with promising results.

407,"This paper develops parametric methods to detect network anomalies using only aggregate traffic statistics, in contrast to other works requiring flow separation, even when the anomaly is a small fraction of the total traffic. By adopting simple statistical models for anomalous and background traffic in the time domain, one can estimate model parameters in real time, thus obviating the need for a long training phase or manual parameter tuning. The proposed bivariate parametric detection mechanism (bPDM) uses a sequential probability ratio test, allowing for control over the false positive rate while examining the tradeoff between detection time and the strength of an anomaly. Additionally, it uses both traffic-rate and packet-size statistics, yielding a bivariate model that eliminates most false positives. The method is analyzed using the bit-rate signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) metric, which is shown to be an effective metric for anomaly detection. The performance of the bPDM is evaluated in three ways. First, synthetically generated traffic provides for a controlled comparison of detection time as a function of the anomalous level of traffic. Second, the approach is shown to be able to detect controlled artificial attacks over the University of Southern California (USC), Los Angeles, campus network in varying real traffic mixes. Third, the proposed algorithm achieves rapid detection of real denial-of-service attacks as determined by the replay of previously captured network traces.

We propose new security metrics that quantify the ability of the adversary to deny access to the control channel, and the overall delay incurred in re-establishing the control channel. We also propose a randomized distributed scheme that allows nodes to establish a new control channel using frequency hopping. Our method differs from classic frequency hopping in that no two nodes share the same hopping sequence, thus mitigating the impact of node compromise. Furthermore, a compromised node is uniquely identified through its hop sequence, leading to its isolation from any future information regarding the frequency location of the control channel.",https://dl.acm.org/ft_gateway.cfm?id=1514299&type=pdf&CFID=160953474&CFTOKEN=7c6f91dd74e9b503-1C0ABB46-9DE0-E00D-1937B1AAC1661724,https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1514299&preflayout=flat,17,662,March 2009,Mitigating control-channel jamming attacks in multi-channel ad hoc networks,WiSec '09: Proceedings of the second ACM conference on Wireless network security

416,"A smart grid is a well-thought-out smart network of meta-systems and subsystems that aims at improving the efficiency the traditional power grid and at ensuring reliable energy delivery. To achieve its goals, a smart grid requires a two-way communication between the utility provider and the end user. One way to achive that is by incorporating the wireless sensor network (WSN) technology into smart grids. A WSN-based smart grid network can bridges virtual and the physical worlds by exploiting the sensing and computing capabilities of smart meters. In particular, a WSN based smart grid comprises numerous small sensing nodes that can sense, read variables from their ambiance, and wirelessly report the readings to each other. Because of cost constraints and miniaturization requirements, these nodes have limitations in terms of available power and computational resources. The resulting resource scarcity imposes new challenges in terms of network and data security, that need to be thoroughly addressed. Hence, the purpose of this paper is to present the current security challenges and attack vectors on WSNs in smart grids and to analyze the existing security solutions.",https://dl.acm.org/ft_gateway.cfm?id=3056789&ftid=1947210&dwn=1&CFID=160953474&CFTOKEN=7c6f91dd74e9b503-1C0ABB46-9DE0-E00D-1937B1AAC1661724,https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3056789&preflayout=flat,0,28,March 2017,Security of wireless sensor network (WSN) in smart grid,"ICC '17: Proceedings of the Second International Conference on Internet of things, Data and Cloud Computing"

419,"A common deployment strategy for wireless sensor networks is to position sensors according to a probabilistic distribution. Some sensor distributions offer advantages in redundancy, which helps ensure network survivability even with the loss of multiple sensor nodes to cyber attack. Properly selecting an initial sensor deployment distribution mitigates the threat of a denial of service (DoS) attack. While it is clear that some distributions are superior to others, it is not clear how to select the best sensor distribution as a defensive measure. Current strategies rely on mathematical analysis and are restricted to a subset of possible distributions. This paper examines the problem from an experimental perspective.

The resulting interference on shared resources often leads to performance degradation and, more importantly, security vulnerabilities. Interference can leak important information ranging from a service's placement to confidential data, like private keys. We present Bolt, a practical system that accurately detects the type and characteristics of applications sharing a cloud platform based on the interference an adversary sees on shared resources. Bolt leverages online data mining techniques that only require 2-5 seconds for detection. In a multi-user study on EC2, Bolt correctly identifies the characteristics of 385 out of 436 diverse workloads. Extracting this information enables a wide spectrum of previously-impractical cloud attacks, including denial of service attacks (DoS) that increase tail latency by 140x, as well as resource freeing (RFA) and co-residency attacks. Finally, we show that while advanced isolation mechanisms, such as cache partitioning lower detection accuracy, they are insufficient to eliminate these vulnerabilities altogether.

In the past, several Root of Trust architectures such as DEFENSE and RETC have been proposed to foil attempts by hardware Trojans to leak sensitive information. In a typical Root of Trust architecture scenario, hardware is allowed to access the memory only by responding properly to a challenge requested by the memory guard. However in a recent effort, we observed that these architectures can in fact be susceptible to a variety of threats ranging from denial of service attacks, privilege escalation to information leakage, by injecting a Trojan into the Root of Trust modules such as memory guards and authorized hardware. In our work, we propose a security monitor that monitors all transactions between the authorized hardware, memory guard and memory. It also authenticates these components through the use of Hashed Message Authentication Codes (HMAC) to detect any invalid memory access or denial of service attack by disrupting the challenge-response pairs.

In the first attack, the attacker adjusts the concentration of the glucose sample and thereby modifies the final result. In the second attack, the attacker tampers with the calibration curve of the assay operation. We then identify denial-of-service attacks, where the attacker can disrupt the assay operation by tampering either with the droplet-routing algorithm or with the actuation sequence.

A simulation based performance evaluation for the proposed protocol was conducted against black hole and acknowledgement-spoofing attacks. Simulations show that, compared to the original directed diffusion protocol, the proposed secure routing protocol achieved better event-delivery and event-dropping ratios.

441,"In this paper, we propose a new approach to preventing and constraining denial-of-service (DoS) attacks. Instead of being able to send anything to anyone at any time, in our architecture, nodes must first obtain ""permission to send"" from the destination; a receiver provides tokens, or capabilities, to those senders whose traffic it agrees to accept. The senders then include these tokens in packets. This enables verification points distributed around the network to check that traffic has been certified as legitimate by both endpoints and the path in between, and to cleanly discard unauthorized traffic. We show that our approach addresses many of the limitations of the currently popular approaches to DoS based on anomaly detection, traceback, and pushback. Further, we argue that our approach can be readily implemented in today's technology, is suitable for incremental deployment, and requires no more of a security infrastructure than that already needed to fix BGP's security weaknesses. Finally, our proposal facilitates innovation in application and networking protocols, something increasingly curtailed by existing DoS measures.",https://dl.acm.org/ft_gateway.cfm?id=972382&ftid=250264&dwn=1&CFID=160953474&CFTOKEN=7c6f91dd74e9b503-1C0ABB46-9DE0-E00D-1937B1AAC1661724,https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=972382&preflayout=flat,33,"1,599",January 2004,Preventing Internet denial-of-service with capabilities,"ACM SIGCOMM Computer Communication Review: Volume 34 Issue 1, January 2004"
442,"Witnessing, firsthand, a tornado in action is something you don't forget; likewise, seeing a Denial of Service attack underway in an isolated lab setting is something you never want to have happen within your real world. Seeing is believing. One immediate reaction is - ""What can I do to keep this from ever taking place?"" This is an example of IT security education at its best. Train future security engineers by introducing them to a controlled disaster, and inspire them to creatively search for a solution that will prevent such a cyber attack. If the Internet conduit to supported systems or the server resources needed to process requests become overwhelmed by invalid requests initiated by a hacker, legitimate clients will be unable to access online services. Attacks that utilize this overload technique are called Denial of Service or DoS attacks. Many mission critical services are time sensitive and can't tolerate time delays. Also, e-commerce sites can lose large sums of revenue when customers can't access their system. As a result, there is an increasing need for security engineers to fully understand the concepts behind DoS attacks in order to initiate the necessary countermeasures. This lab was created by undergraduates and shows how to successfully construct a DoS lab, as well as the methods used to isolate the lab environment from external networks. The isolated laboratory environment used is the IT Sandbox at an institution of higher education focused on educating IT engineers. The DoS lab demonstrates how TCP SYN, ICMP floods, and LAND attacks exhaust system and/or network resources. Additionally, the lab precipitates critical thought on how best to mitigate DoS and Distributed DoS attacks in the real world.",https://dl.acm.org/ft_gateway.cfm?id=1029551&ftid=285233&dwn=1&CFID=160953474&CFTOKEN=7c6f91dd74e9b503-1C0ABB46-9DE0-E00D-1937B1AAC1661724,https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1029551&preflayout=flat,1,626,October 2004,Safely train security engineers regarding the dangers presented by denial of service attacks,CITC5 '04: Proceedings of the 5th conference on Information technology education

Such detection is a pivotal part of any security tools like intrusion detection system, intrusion prevention system, and firewalls etc. Therefore, an approach is provided in this paper to analyze denial of service attack by using a supervised neural network. The methodology used sampled data from Kddcup99 dataset, an attack database that is a standard for judgment of attack detection tools.

444,"Group subscription is a useful mechanism for multicast
congestion control: RLM, RLC, FLID-DL, and WEBRC form a promising

451,"Denial of Service (DoS) attacks represent a major threat to network security, especially in today's networked world. There has been significant research in this area, primarily focused on mitigating and preventing DoS attacks affecting transport layer services. This paper addresses issues arising from a new variation of a DoS attack, namely the SlowPOST attack that affects Application Layer services. In SlowPOST, the malicious clients send data at a slow rate after the connection is established, and the server is left waiting for the data to arrive. These attacks are particularly devastating due to their ability to resist detection due to their protocol compliance. In addition, such attacks do not require the massive resources that DoS attacks normally require, making them easier to launch. Some solutions for this issue have already been deployed in some commercial servers. These solutions are based on either monitoring traffic or enforcing a time limit on the transmission of the protocol headers. In order to achieve reliable detection, the detection parameters need to adapt to the constantly changing traffic. This paper proposes a novel algorithm that uses the data rate of connections to evolve a threshold for determining potential attackers in SlowPOST. This proposed method is tested by subjecting a server to an attack, and it was observed that in the absence of this method, the servicing of legitimate requests is not completed.",https://dl.acm.org/ft_gateway.cfm?id=2507310&ftid=1391063&dwn=1&CFID=160953474&CFTOKEN=7c6f91dd74e9b503-1C0ABB46-9DE0-E00D-1937B1AAC1661724,https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2507310&preflayout=flat,1,89,August 2013,Data rate based adaptive thread assignment solution for combating the SlowPOST denial of service attack,"ACM SIGSOFT Software Engineering Notes: Volume 38 Issue 5, September 2013"

QoS is not about the typical case; it is about the worst case.Researchers have all too often assumed ""normal network conditions"" and developed forms of QoS that do not take into account adversarial considerations.We argue that adversarial analysis needs to be performed on any QoS technique. The questions that need to be answered include: What are the consequences of a compromise of a host? A router? If no routers are compromised in a given domain, will it be always able to fulfill its QoS promises? If this is not the case, how many neighbors (and with what peering link capacities) does an adversary need to compromise to deny service to a specific pair of communicating hosts or, for a specific host, to deny service to some or all destinations? How can the operator control the possibility of DoS?

455,"Recently, we have seen increasing numbers of denial of service (DoS) attacks against online services and Web applications either for extortion reasons or for impairing and even disabling the competition. These DoS attacks have increasingly targeted the application level. Application-level DoS attacks emulate the same request syntax and network-level traffic characteristics as those of legitimate clients, thereby making the attacks much harder to detect and counter. Moreover, such attacks often target bottleneck resources such as disk bandwidth, database bandwidth, and CPU resources. In this article, we propose handling DoS attacks by using a twofold mechanism. First, we perform admission control to limit the number of concurrent clients served by the online service. Admission control is based on port hiding that renders the online service invisible to unauthorized clients by hiding the port number on which the service accepts incoming requests. Second, we perform congestion control on admitted clients to allocate more resources to good clients. Congestion control is achieved by adaptively setting a client's priority level in response to the client's requests in a way that can incorporate application-level semantics. We present a detailed evaluation of the proposed solution using two sample applications: Apache HTTPD and the TPCW benchmark (running on Apache Tomcat and IBM DB2).

We show the unsuitability of tools such as control chart, used in statistical process control (SPC), to detect DoS and propose an anomaly-based intrusion detection system that uses a combination of chi-square test & control chart to first detect intrusion and then identify an intruder. When the intruder is isolated from the network we show reduced overhead and increased throughput. Simulation results show that our algorithm performs well at an affordable processing overhead over the range of scenarios tested.",https://dl.acm.org/ft_gateway.cfm?id=1582581&ftid=646575&dwn=1&CFID=160953474&CFTOKEN=7c6f91dd74e9b503-1C0ABB46-9DE0-E00D-1937B1AAC1661724,https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1582581&preflayout=flat,11,799,June 2009,Adaptive intrusion detection & prevention of denial of service attacks in MANETs,IWCMC '09: Proceedings of the 2009 International Conference on Wireless Communications and Mobile Computing: Connecting the World Wirelessly

The Industries and Data Centers are curious to know how a SDN product will support them that their data, supporting applications and built in infrastructure are not vulnerable to threats. The initiation of SDN, will demand new pathways for securing control plane traffic. The traditional networks usually trust switching intelligence to implement various defense mechanisms besides known attacks.

467,"Defending against denial-of-service (DoS) in a mobile ad hoc network (MANET) is challenging because the network topology is dynamic and nodes are selfish. In this paper, we propose a DoS mitigation technique that uses digital signatures to verify legitimate packets, and drop packets that do not pass the verification. Since nodes are selfish, they may not perform the verification so that they can avoid paying the overhead. A bad packet that escapes verification along the whole network path will bring a penalty to all its forwarders. A network game can be formulated in which nodes along a network path, in optimizing their own benefits, are encouraged to act collectively to filter out bad packets. Analytical results show that Nash equilibrium can be attained for players in the proposed game, in which significant benefits can be provided to forwarders such that many of the bad packets will be eliminated by verification.",https://dl.acm.org/ft_gateway.cfm?id=1229329&ftid=422227&dwn=1&CFID=160953474&CFTOKEN=7c6f91dd74e9b503-1C0ABB46-9DE0-E00D-1937B1AAC1661724,https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1229329&preflayout=flat,3,541,March 2007,Mitigating denial-of-service attacks in MANET by distributed packet filtering: a game-theoretic approach,"ASIACCS '07: Proceedings of the 2nd ACM symposium on Information, computer and communications security"
468,"Mobile ad hoc networks are especially susceptible to denial-of-service attacks due to the lack of infrastructure, the imperfections of the wireless channel, and the limitations of the mobile devices. In principle, providing quality-of-service and resistance against flooding attacks can be achieved with per-flow management. However, a per-flow management scheme makes a mobile device vulnerable to state table exhaustion attacks. To avoid such attacks some degree of flow aggregation is necessary, but such aggregation tends to have a negative impact on flow fairness. We introduce a quantitative metric for the fairness experienced by a flow in the presence of flooding attacks and develop a model to study the impact of flow aggregation on the fairness experienced by a flow in the presence of flooding attacks. We propose a dynamic 3-level flow aggregation scheme, which is able to maintain a high degree of flow fairness even with a relatively small state table size.

Recently, these attacks have evolved from simple flooding at the network layer to targeted, application-specific asymmetric attacks. Because of this trend, existing techniques---which rely primarily on network classification at the edge or core routing devices---are becoming ineffective. Our platform integrates machine learning with fine-grained application-level performance metrics and monitoring statistics at the software's components to achieve precise traffic classification for detecting application-specific attacks in real time. When an attack is detected, the platform will then automatically isolate suspicious traffic by routing it to separate component instances with a fixed resource reservation, thus preventing it from interfering with the rest of the system. Our evaluation using a range of asymmetric attacks shows that our detection technique is highly effective and that the close-loop integration of real-time detection and traffic isolation can deliver substantially better quality-of-service for good users in the presence of attacks than the default mitigation using dynamic scaling of resource alone.",https://dl.acm.org/ft_gateway.cfm?id=3229589&ftid=1987546&dwn=1&CFID=160953474&CFTOKEN=7c6f91dd74e9b503-1C0ABB46-9DE0-E00D-1937B1AAC1661724,https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3229589&preflayout=flat,0,288,August 2018,Automated Detection and Mitigation of Application-level Asymmetric DoS Attacks,SelfDN 2018: Proceedings of the Afternoon Workshop on Self-Driving Networks

489,"Intel Software Guard Extensions (SGX) provides a strongly isolated memory space, known as an enclave, for a user process, ensuring confidentiality and integrity against software and hardware attacks. Even the operating system and hypervisor cannot access the enclave because of the hardware-level isolation. Further, hardware attacks are neither able to disclose plaintext data from the enclave because its memory is always encrypted nor modify it because its integrity is always verified using an integrity tree. When the processor detects any integrity violation, it locks itself to prevent further damages; that is, a system reboot is necessary. The processor lock seems a reasonable solution against such a powerful hardware attacker; however, if a software attacker has a way to trigger integrity violation, the lock could result in a severe denial-of-service (DoS) attack.",https://dl.acm.org/ft_gateway.cfm?id=3152709&ftid=1927280&dwn=1&CFID=160953474&CFTOKEN=7c6f91dd74e9b503-1C0ABB46-9DE0-E00D-1937B1AAC1661724,https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3152709&preflayout=flat,6,320,October 2017,SGX-Bomb: Locking Down the Processor via Rowhammer Attack,SysTEX'17: Proceedings of the 2nd Workshop on System Software for Trusted Execution
490,"Nowadays, the popular Android is so closely involved in people's daily lives that people rely on Android to perform critical operations and trust Android with sensitive information. It is of great importance to guarantee the usability and security of Android which, however, is such a huge system that a potential threat may arise from any part of it. In this paper, we focus on the Free Floating window (FF window) which is a category of windows that can appear freely above any other applications. It can share the screen space with other FF windows, dialogs, and activities. An FF window is flexible in both its appearance and behaviour features. We analyse the behaviour features of FF windows, including the priority in display layer and the capability of processing user-generated events. Three types of attacks via FF windows with delicate design in their appearance and behaviour features are demonstrated, i.e., DoS attack against Android system, GUI hijacking by targeting overlap, and input inference using FF windows as a side channel. To address the threat caused by FF windows, we design a priority framework for FF windows, which protects a sensitive activity/FF window declared by developers from being attacked by any malicious FF windows. A complementary solution is proposed to mitigate the confusion attack from malicious activities. Finally, we provide Android with suggestions on how to manage FF windows.",https://dl.acm.org/ft_gateway.cfm?id=2897897&ftid=1730856&dwn=1&CFID=160953474&CFTOKEN=7c6f91dd74e9b503-1C0ABB46-9DE0-E00D-1937B1AAC1661724,https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2897897&preflayout=flat,2,313,May 2016,Attacks and Defence on Android Free Floating Windows,ASIA CCS '16: Proceedings of the 11th ACM on Asia Conference on Computer and Communications Security
491,"In this short paper, we take a first step towards empirically assessing Internet-wide malicious activities generated from and targeted towards Internet-scale business sectors (i.e., financial, health, education, etc.) and critical infrastructure (i.e., utilities, manufacturing, government, etc.). Facilitated by an innovative and a collaborative large-scale effort, we have conducted discussions with numerous Internet entities to obtain rare and private information related to allocated IP blocks pertaining to the aforementioned sectors and critical infrastructure. To this end, we employ such information to attribute Internet-scale maliciousness to such sectors and realms, in an attempt to provide an in-depth analysis of the global cyber situational posture. We draw upon close to 16.8 TB of darknet data to infer probing activities (typically generated by malicious/infected hosts) and DDoS backscatter, from which we distill IP addresses of victims. By executing week-long measurements, we observed an alarming number of more than 11,000 probing machines and 300 DDoS attack victims hosted by critical sectors. We also generate rare insights related to the maliciousness of various business sectors, including financial, which typically do not report their hosted and targeted illicit activities for reputation-preservation purposes. While we treat the obtained results with strict confidence due to obvious sensitivity reasons, we postulate that such generated cyber threat intelligence could be shared with sector/critical infrastructure operators, backbone networks and Internet service providers to contribute to the overall threat remediation objective.",https://dl.acm.org/ft_gateway.cfm?id=3230837&ftid=1993446&dwn=1&CFID=160953474&CFTOKEN=7c6f91dd74e9b503-1C0ABB46-9DE0-E00D-1937B1AAC1661724,https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3230837&preflayout=flat,0,98,August 2018,Assessing Internet-wide Cyber Situational Awareness of Critical Sectors,"ARES 2018: Proceedings of the 13th International Conference on Availability, Reliability and Security"

493,"ION is a unified memory management interface for Android that is widely used on virtually all ARM based Android devices. ION attempts to achieve several ambitious goals that have not been simultaneously achieved before (not even on Linux). Different from managing regular memory in the system, ION is designed to share and manage memory with special constraints, e.g., physically contiguous memory. Despite the great flexibility and performance benefits offered, such a critical subsystem, as we discover, unfortunately has flawed security assumptions and designs. In this paper, we systematically analyze ION related vulnerabilities from conceptual root causes to detailed implementation decisions. Since ION is often customized heavily for different Android devices, the specific vulnerabilities often manifest themselves differently. By conducting a range of runtime testing as well as static analysis, we are able to uncover a large number of serious vulnerabilities on the latest Android devices (e.g., Nexus 6P running Android 6.0 and 7.0 preview) such as denial-of-service and dumping memory from the system and arbitrary applications (e.g., email content, passwords). Finally, we offer suggestions on how to redesign the ION subsystem to eliminate these flaws.

We consider the problem of defending the system against multiple data falsification attacks (Byzantine attacks), a vulnerability of distributed peer-to-peer consensus algorithms that has not been widely addressed in its practicality. We consider both naive (independent) and colluding attackers. We test three defense strategy implementations, two classified as outlier detection methods and one reputation-based method. We have narrowed our attention to outlier and reputation-based methods because they are relatively light computationally speaking. We have left out control theoretic methods which are likely the most effective methods, however their computational cost increase rapidly with the number of attackers. We compare the efficiency of these three implementations for their computational cost, detection performance, convergence behavior and possible impacts on the intrusion detection accuracy of the NIDS.

Also, 6LoWPAN devices are mostly deployed in unattended environments, hence easy to capture and clone. Despite that state of the art crypto solutions provide information security, IPv6 enabled smart objects are vulnerable to attacks from outside and inside 6LoWPAN networks that are aimed to disrupt networks. This paper attempts to identify intrusions aimed to disrupt the Routing Protocol for Low-Power and Lossy Networks (RPL).In order to improve the security within 6LoWPAN networks, we extend SVELTE, an intrusion detection system for the Internet of Things, with an intrusion detection module that uses the ETX (Expected Transmissions) metric. In RPL, ETX is a link reliability metric and monitoring the ETX value can prevent an intruder from actively engaging 6LoWPAN nodes in malicious activities.

496,"With its high penetration rate and relatively good clock accuracy, smartphones are replacing watches in several market segments. Modern smartphones have more than one clock source to complement each other: NITZ (Network Identity and Time Zone), NTP (Network Time Protocol), and GNSS (Global Navigation Satellite System) including GPS. NITZ information is delivered by the cellular core network, indicating the network name and clock information. NTP provides a facility to synchronize the clock with a time server. Among these clock sources, only NITZ and NTP are updated without user interaction, as location services require manual activation. In this paper, we analyze security aspects of these clock sources and their impact on security features of modern smartphones. In particular, we investigate NITZ and NTP procedures over cellular networks (2G, 3G and 4G) and Wi-Fi communication respectively. Furthermore, we analyze several European, Asian, and American cellular networks from NITZ perspective. We identify three classes of vulnerabilities: specification issues in a cellular protocol, configurational issues in cellular network deployments, and implementation issues in different mobile OS's. We demonstrate how an attacker with low cost setup can spoof NITZ and NTP messages to cause Denial of Service attacks.

During such attack, the legal internal states can be consumed by the DoS attack. Then the attacker can observe the behavior of the attacked tag in authentication to break privacy. Due to the inadequate energy and computing power, the low cost devices can hardly defend against the DoS attacks. In this paper, we propose a new insight of the DoS attack on tags and leverage the attacking behavior as a new source of power harvesting.

501,"With essential privileges, native daemons provide core system services for apps in the Android system. However, we find that exploiting Android native daemons can still lead to another security issue: the privilege abuse within the confined privilege. So, in this paper, we firstly demonstrate the privilege abuse problem in native daemons through two types of attacks: the data leakage attack and the Denial-of-Service (DoS) attack. To mitigate the privilege abuse issue, we then propose the Daemon-Guard framework, in which we build a dispatcher to fork a new daemon process for handling each service request from apps. The dispatcher can check the ownership of data and determine whether a data access operation is authorized, and check the speed of the service requests from an app by a reference monitor. To restrict a daemon process accessing data in the file system, we deploy Seccomp, a capability system supported by the Linux kernel. At last, we implement the Daemon-Guard framework on the keystore daemon through the static instrumentation. The evaluation of the keystore case shows that Daemon-Guard can successfully prevent these two privilege abuse attacks with an acceptable performance overhead.",https://dl.acm.org/ft_gateway.cfm?id=3203428&ftid=1976877&dwn=1&CFID=160953474&CFTOKEN=7c6f91dd74e9b503-1C0ABB46-9DE0-E00D-1937B1AAC1661724,https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3203428&preflayout=flat,1,54,May 2018,Daemon-Guard: Towards Preventing Privilege Abuse Attacks in Android Native Daemons,RESEC '18: Proceedings of the First Workshop on Radical and Experiential Security

513,"Consensus algorithms provide strategies to solve problems in a distributed system with the added constraint that data can only be shared between adjacent computing nodes. We find these algorithms in applications for wireless and sensor networks, spectrum sensing for cognitive radio, even for some IoT services. However, consensus-based applications are not resilient to compromised nodes sending falsified data to their neighbors, i.e. they can be the target of Byzantine attacks. Several solutions have been proposed in the literature inspired from reputation based systems, outlier detection or model-based fault detection techniques in process control. We have reviewed some of these solutions, and propose two mitigation techniques to protect the consensus-based Network Intrusion Detection System in [1].

514,"The moving network target defense (MTD) based approach to security aims to design and develop capabilities to dynamically change the attack surfaces to make it more difficult for attackers to strike. One such capability is to dynamically change the IP addresses of subnetworks in unpredictable ways in an attempt to disrupt the ability of an attacker to collect the necessary reconnaissance information to launch successful attacks. In particular, Denial of Service (DoS) and worms represent examples of distributed attacks that can potentially propagate through networks very quickly, but could also be disrupted by MTD. Conversely, MTD are also disruptive to regular users. For example, when IP addresses are changed dynamically it is no longer effective to use DNS caches for IP address resolutions before any communication can be performed. In this work we take another approach. We note that the deployment of MTD could be triggered through the use of light-weight intrusion detection. We demonstrate that the neuro-evolution of augmented topologies algorithm (NEAT) has the capacity to construct detectors that operate on packet data and produce sparse topologies, hence are real-time in operation. Benchmarking under examples of DoS and worm attacks indicates that NEAT detectors can be constructed from relatively small amounts of data and detect attacks approx. 90% accuracy. Additional experiments with the open-ended evolution of code modules through genetic program teams provided detection rates approaching 100%. We believe that adopting such an approach to MTB a more specific deployment strategy that is less invasive to legitimate users, while disrupting the actions of malicious users.",https://dl.acm.org/ft_gateway.cfm?id=2931681&ftid=1771435&dwn=1&CFID=160953474&CFTOKEN=7c6f91dd74e9b503-1C0ABB46-9DE0-E00D-1937B1AAC1661724,https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2931681&preflayout=flat,1,97,July 2016,Initiating a Moving Target Network Defense with a Real-time Neuro-evolutionary Detector,GECCO '16 Companion: Proceedings of the 2016 on Genetic and Evolutionary Computation Conference Companion

524,"In cloud computing, network Denial of Service (DoS) attacks are well studied and defenses have been implemented, but severe DoS attacks on a victim's working memory by a single hostile VM are not well understood. Memory DoS attacks are Denial of Service (or Degradation of Service) attacks caused by contention for hardware memory resources on a cloud server. Despite the strong memory isolation techniques for virtual machines (VMs) enforced by the software virtualization layer in cloud servers, the underlying hardware memory layers are still shared by the VMs and can be exploited by a clever attacker in a hostile VM co-located on the same server as the victim VM, denying the victim the working memory he needs. We first show quantitatively the severity of contention on different memory resources. We then show that a malicious cloud customer can mount low-cost attacks to cause severe performance degradation for a Hadoop distributed application, and 38X delay in response time for an E-commerce website in the Amazon EC2 cloud. Then, we design an effective, new defense against these memory DoS attacks, using a statistical metric to detect their existence and execution throttling to mitigate the attack damage. We achieve this by a novel re-purposing of existing hardware performance counters and duty cycle modulation for security, rather than for improving performance or power consumption. We implement a full prototype on the OpenStack cloud system.

A malicious source vehicle could deny beacon messages of a target ITS application and intelligently cover-up this denial with signal loss faced due to wireless channel error and surrounding environment obstacles. In this context, we propose a lightweight technique to detect a beacon denial attacker using Auto-Correlation Function (ACF). This technique possesses higher detection accuracy in comparison to fixed threshold scheme which depends upon the number of beacon messages denied by the source vehicle. Furthermore, we propose a random vehicle inspection scheme for inspecting randomly chosen set of vehicles for beacon denial attack.

In this paper, we develop a cyber-physical simulation platform that interconnects Mininet (an SDN emulator), hardware SDN switches, and PowerWorld (a high-fidelity, industry-strength power grid simulator). We report initial experiments on how a number of representative controller faults may impact the delay of smart grid communications. We further evaluate how this delay may affect the performance of the underlying physical system, namely automatic gain control (AGC) as a fundamental closed-loop control that regulates the grid frequency to a critical nominal value. Our results show that when the fault-induced delay reaches seconds (e.g., more than four seconds in some of our experiments), degradation of the AGC becomes evident. Particularly, the AGC is most vulnerable when it is in a transient following say step changes in loading, because the significant state fluctuations will exacerbate the effects of using a stale system state in the control.",https://dl.acm.org/ft_gateway.cfm?id=2899020&ftid=1727287&dwn=1&CFID=160953474&CFTOKEN=7c6f91dd74e9b503-1C0ABB46-9DE0-E00D-1937B1AAC1661724,https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2899020&preflayout=flat,1,250,May 2016,A Simulation Study on Smart Grid Resilience under Software-Defined Networking Controller Failures,CPSS '16: Proceedings of the 2nd ACM International Workshop on Cyber-Physical System Security

The to-be-embedded data are represented by different orthogonal spreading sequences and embedded into a cover image while degrading the image quality slightly. According to the feature of orthogonality, different spreading sequences are repeatedly embedded into the image without disturbing each other, and most elements of different spreading sequences are mutually cancelled in the process of multilevel data embedding. Thus, it keeps the distortion of the embedded image at a relatively low level even with a high embedding capacity. Moreover, the location-map of the proposed scheme can be highly compressed and thus the size is quite small; it further helps to obtain high net embedding capacity. Experimental results have demonstrated that the CDMA based reversible data hiding scheme can achieve higher image quality at the moderate-to-high embedding capacity than other state-of-the-art reversible data hiding works.",https://dl.acm.org/ft_gateway.cfm?id=2930790&ftid=1738911&dwn=1&CFID=160953474&CFTOKEN=7c6f91dd74e9b503-1C0ABB46-9DE0-E00D-1937B1AAC1661724,https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2930790&preflayout=flat,0,105,June 2016,A Novel CDMA Based High Performance Reversible Data Hiding Scheme,IH&MMSec '16: Proceedings of the 4th ACM Workshop on Information Hiding and Multimedia Security

532,"WAN bandwidth remains a constrained resource that is economically infeasible to substantially overprovision. Hence, it is important to allocate capacity according to service priority and based on the incremental value of additional allocation. For example, it may be the highest priority for one service to receive 10Gb/s of bandwidth but upon reaching such an allocation, incremental priority may drop sharply favoring allocation to other services. Motivated by the observation that individual flows with fixed priority may not be the ideal basis for bandwidth allocation, we present the design and implementation of Bandwidth Enforcer (BwE), a global, hierarchical bandwidth allocation infrastructure. BwE supports: i) service-level bandwidth allocation following prioritized bandwidth functions where a service can represent an arbitrary collection of flows, ii)independent allocation and delegation policies according to user-defined hierarchy, all accounting for a global view of bandwidth and failure conditions, iii) multi-path forwarding common in traffic-engineered networks, and iv) a central administrative point to override (perhaps faulty) policy during exceptional conditions.

534,"Learning to discriminate between secure and hostile patterns is a crucial problem for species to survive in nature. Mimetism and camouflage are well-known examples of evolving weapons and defenses in the arms race between predators and preys. It is thus clear that all of the information acquired by our senses should not be considered necessarily secure or reliable. In machine learning and pattern recognition systems, however, we have started investigating these issues only recently. This phenomenon has been especially observed in the context of adversarial settings like malware detection and spam filtering, in which data can be purposely manipulated by humans to undermine the outcome of an automatic analysis. As current pattern recognition methods are not natively designed to deal with the intrinsic, adversarial nature of these problems, they exhibit specific vulnerabilities that an attacker may exploit either to mislead learning or to evade detection. Identifying these vulnerabilities and analyzing the impact of the corresponding attacks on learning algorithms has thus been one of the main open issues in the novel research field of adversarial machine learning, along with the design of more secure learning algorithms.",https://dl.acm.org/ft_gateway.cfm?id=2930784&ftid=1738906&dwn=1&CFID=160953474&CFTOKEN=7c6f91dd74e9b503-1C0ABB46-9DE0-E00D-1937B1AAC1661724,https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2930784&preflayout=flat,0,472,June 2016,Machine Learning under Attack: Vulnerability Exploitation and Security Measures,IH&MMSec '16: Proceedings of the 4th ACM Workshop on Information Hiding and Multimedia Security

536,"The successful operations of modern power grids are highly dependent on a reliable and efficient underlying communication network. Researchers and utilities have started to explore the opportunities and challenges of applying the emerging software-defined networking (SDN) technology to enhance efficiency and resilience of the Smart Grid. This trend calls for a simulation-based platform that provides sufficient flexibility and controllability for evaluating network application designs, and facilitating the transitions from in-house research ideas to real productions. In this paper, we present DSSnet, a hybrid testing platform that combines a power distribution system simulator with an SDN emulator to support high fidelity analysis of communication network applications and their impacts on the power systems. Our contributions lay in the design of a virtual time system with the tight controllability on the execution of the emulation system, i.e., pausing and resuming any specified container processes in the perception of their own virtual clocks, with little overhead scaling to 500 emulated hosts with an average of 70 ms overhead; and also lay in the efficient synchronization of the two sub-systems based on the virtual time.

537,"The focus of this short paper has been to use a Raspberry Pi device to perform certain network attacks and exploit vulnerabilities in existing systems. To this end, we developed a new attack tool that can be installed on a Raspberry Pi and allows novice users to perform a Man-in-the-Middle attack and a small-scale Denial-of-Service attack. The first attack has been designed in such a way so that the attacker can gather credentials of legitimate users even when they try to visit websites that are running under SSL/TLS and they have enabled the HSTS protocol. Regarding the second attack, the attacker has the ability to control a set of malicious Raspberry Pi's and intentionally attempt to stop legitimate users from accessing services. The attacker can select a specific target in the network and overload the corresponding device by sending several fake requests.

Whereas the Internet originated as a way to connect traditional computing devices in order to share information, IoT includes everything from automobiles to appliances to buildings. As networks and devices become more diverse and disparate in their communication methods and interfaces, traditional host-to host technologies such as Internet Protocol (IP) are challenged to provide the level of data exchange and security needed to operate in this new network paradigm. Named Data Networking (NDN) is a developing Internet architecture that can help implement the IoT paradigm in a more efficient and secure manner.

539,"Mobile apps need optimal performance and responsiveness to rise amongst numerous rivals on the market. Further, some apps like media streaming or gaming apps cannot even function properly with a performance below a certain threshold. In this work, we present the first performance degradation attack on Android OS that can target rival apps using a combination of logical channel leakages and low-level architectural bottlenecks in the underlying hardware. To show the viability of the attack, we design a proof-of-concept app and test it on various mobile platforms. The attack runs covertly and brings the target to the level of unresponsiveness. With less than 10% CPU time in the worst case, it requires minimal computational effort to run as a background service, and requires only the UsageStats permission from the user. We quantify the impact of our attack using 11 popular benchmark apps, running 44 different tests.} The measured QoS degradation varies across platforms and applications, reaching a maximum of 90\% in some cases. The attack combines the leakage from logical channels with low-level architectural bottlenecks to design a malicious app that can covertly degrade Quality of Service (QoS) of any targeted app. Furthermore, our attack code has a small footprint and is not detected by the Android system as malicious.

540,"With network traffic rates continuously growing, security systems like firewalls are facing increasing challenges to process incoming packets at line speed without sacrificing protection. Accordingly, specialized hardware firewalls are increasingly used in high-speed environments. Hardware solutions, though, are inherently limited in terms of the complexity of the policies they can implement, often forcing users to choose between throughput and comprehensive analysis. On the contrary, complex rules typically constitute only a small fraction of the rule set. This motivates the combination of massively parallel, yet complexity-limited specialized circuitry with a slower, but semantically powerful software firewall. The key challenge in such a design arises from the dependencies between classification rules due to their relative priorities within the rule set: complex rules requiring software-based processing may be interleaved at arbitrary positions between those where hardware processing is feasible. We therefore discuss approaches for partitioning and transforming rule sets for hybrid packet processing, and propose HyPaFilter, a hybrid classification system based on tailored circuitry on an FPGA as an accelerator for a Linux netfilter firewall.

541,"Earlier research focus towards anomaly detection has been towards using classifiers such as kNN, SVM and using existing distance measures to perform classification. Traditionally IDSs (Intrusion detection systems) have been developed by applying machine learning techniques and adopted single learning mechanism. This is later extended by developing Intrusion Detection Systems by adopting multiple learning mechanisms. Such systems have addressed better detection rates compared to single learning Intrusion Detection Systems. Dimensionality is one more serious concern which affects the performance of classification algorithms. Approaches such as ""Feature selection"" have been studied and adopted which selects a subset features from the feature set. However, the feature extraction approach for dimensionality reduction has proved to be better compared to feature selection and achieved better classification and detection rates. In this research, we address ""Feature extraction"" using ""Evolutionary feature clustering"" by proposing a ""Novel fuzzy membership function"" which addresses Dimensionality Reduction (DR). The idea is to transform the initial connection representation so that its equivalent representation has reduced noise affect and achieves better classification or detection rates. Experimental results on KDD datasets with 19 and 41 attributes, prove that the proposed approach has improved detection rates for R2L and U2R attack classes when compared to CANN, CLAPP, and SVM approaches. CANN approach recorded lower detection rates w.r.t U2R and R2L attacks. This failure is addressed in our earlier studies through proposing, CLAPP which proved comparatively better accuracy rates to CANN.

We uncover its security vulnerabilities and exploit them to devise four SMS attacks: silent SMS abuse, SMS spoofing, SMS client DoS, and SMS spamming. We further discover that those SMS threats can propagate towards SMS-powered services, thereby leading to three malicious attacks: social network account hijacking, unauthorized donation, and unauthorized subscription.

549,"Intrusion detection systems (IDS) based on machine learning (ML) can be used to detect anomalies in data traffic. Common challenges for IDSs are low detection rates, high false alarm rates, and the need to process large amount of data. In order to overcome these challenges various types of supervised, semi-supervised and unsupervised ML methods are being widely researched. However, the need for high-performance processing capabilities in order to perform the calculations restricts the use in industrial control systems (ICS) with usually small embedded processing elements. In this paper, a comparison of key ML methods is carried out that focuses on data traffic and processing requirements for the application to ICS. Furthermore, a variant of growing hierarchical self-organizing maps (GHSOM) is described that proposes a new method to detect anomalies based on the GHSOM behaviour. The influence of the GHSOM parameters on the detection ratio of different kinds of attacks on a production line for the proposed method is examined. To detect attacks on the ICS, growth criteria of the GHSOM have been applied as alarm generating conditions. The comparison of the performance of GHSOM, Feedforward Artificial Neural Network (ANN), Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Local Outlier Factor (LOF) took place based on receiver operating characteristics of the classification between normal and anomalous data captured from a real industrial line testbed.

556,"Network Management is a critical process for an enterprise to configure and monitor the network devices using cost effective methods. It is imperative for it to be robust and free from adversarial or accidental security flaws. With the advent of cloud computing and increasing demands for centralized network control, conventional management protocols like SNMP appear inadequate and newer techniques like NMDA and NETCONF have been invented. However, unlike SNMP which underwent improvements concentrating on security, the new data management and storage techniques have not been scrutinized for the inherent security flaws. In this paper, we identify several vulnerabilities in the widely used critical infrastructures which leverage the Network Management Datastore Architecture design (NMDA). Software Defined Networking (SDN), a proponent of NMDA, heavily relies on its datastores to program and manage the network. We base our research on the security challenges put forth by the existing datastore's design as implemented by the SDN controllers.

557,"A fundamental limitation of Bitcoin and its variants is that the movement of coin between addresses can be observed by examining the public block chain. This record enables adversaries to link addresses to individuals, and to identify multiple addresses as belonging to a single participant. Users can try to hide this information by mixing, where a participant exchanges the funds in an address coin-for-coin with another participant and address. In this paper, we describe the weaknesses of extant mixing protocols, and analyze their vulnerability to Sybil-based denial-of-service and inference attacks. As a solution, we propose Xim, a two-party mixing protocol that is compatible with Bitcoin and related virtual currencies. It is the first decentralized protocol to simultaneously address Sybil attackers, denial-of-service attacks, and timing-based inference attacks. Xim is a multi-round protocol with tunably high success rates. It includes a decentralized system for anonymously finding mix partners based on ads placed in the block chain. No outside party can confirm or find evidence of participants that pair up. We show that Xim's design increases attacker costs linearly with the total number of participants, and that its probabilistic approach to mixing mitigates Sybil-based denial-of-service attack effects. We evaluate protocol delays based on our measurements of the Bitcoin network.",https://dl.acm.org/ft_gateway.cfm?id=2665955&ftid=1512061&dwn=1&CFID=160953474&CFTOKEN=7c6f91dd74e9b503-1C0ABB46-9DE0-E00D-1937B1AAC1661724,https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2665955&preflayout=flat,8,446,November 2014,Sybil-Resistant Mixing for Bitcoin,WPES '14: Proceedings of the 13th Workshop on Privacy in the Electronic Society
558,"Name services are critical for mapping logical resource names to physical resources in large-scale distributed systems. The Domain Name System (DNS) used on the Internet, however, is slow, vulnerable to denial of service attacks, and does not support fast updates. These problems stem fundamentally from the structure of the legacy DNS.This paper describes the design and implementation of the Cooperative Domain Name System (CoDoNS), a novel name service, which provides high lookup performance through proactive caching, resilience to denial of service attacks through automatic load-balancing, and fast propagation of updates. CoDoNS derives its scalability, decentralization, self-organization, and failure resilience from peer-to-peer overlays, while it achieves high performance using the Beehive replication framework. Cryptographic delegation, instead of host-based physical delegation, limits potential malfeasance by namespace operators and creates a competitive market for namespace management. Backwards compatibility with existing protocols and wire formats enables CoDoNS to serve as a backup for legacy DNS, as well as a complete replacement. Performance measurements from a real-life deployment of the system in PlanetLab shows that CoDoNS provides fast lookups, automatically reconfigures around faults without manual involvement and thwarts distributed denial of service attacks by promptly redistributing load across nodes.",https://dl.acm.org/ft_gateway.cfm?id=1015504&ftid=274234&dwn=1&CFID=160953474&CFTOKEN=7c6f91dd74e9b503-1C0ABB46-9DE0-E00D-1937B1AAC1661724,https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1015504&preflayout=flat,65,"2,210",August 2004,The design and implementation of a next generation name service for the internet,"SIGCOMM '04: Proceedings of the 2004 conference on Applications, technologies, architectures, and protocols for computer communications"

Although the typical industrial applications operate at low data rates, they pose unique challenges because of their critical demands for reliable and real-time communication in harsh industrial environments.

Battery-powered wireless modules easily and inexpensively retrofit existing sensors and actuators in industrial facilities without running cabling for communication and power. To address the stringent real-time and reliability requirements, WSANs adopt a set of novel design choices such as employing the Time-Synchronized Channel Hopping (TSCH) technology that distinguish themselves from traditional Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) that require only best effort services. The equation-based channel hopping used in TSCH simplifies the network operations at the cost of security.

We analyze the performance and energy consumption of such a network, and consider the impact of random and targeted denial-of-service and censorship attacks. To gather wireless connectivity traces for a DTN composed of human-carried commodity smartphones, we implemented and deployed a prototype DTN-based micro-blogging application, called 1am, in a college town. We analyzed the system during a time period with 111 users. Although the study provided detailed enough connectivity traces to enable analysis, message posting was too infrequent to draw strong conclusions based on user-initiated messages, alone. We therefore simulated more frequent message initiations and used measured connectivity traces to analyze message propagation. Using a flooding protocol, we found that with an adoption rate of 0.2% of a college town's student and faculty population, the median one-week delivery rate is 85% and the median delivery delay is 13 hours. We also found that the network delivery rate and delay are robust to denial-of service and censorship attacks eliminating more than half of the participants.

607,"Prior research on anonymous communication networks has focused, to a large extent, on achieving, measuring, and evaluating anonymity properties. In this work we address another important security property that has so far received much less attention, namely resilience against denial-of-service attacks that degrade the performance of the network. We formally define resilience and propose a metric for quantifying the resilience of anonymous communication networks (ACNs) against active adversaries. Our metric expresses the degradation in quality of service of an ACN as the decrease in performance resulting from the adversarial removal or disabling of network nodes. We illustrate the practicality of the metric by applying it to a simulated version of the Tor network, and providing an evaluation of the resilience of Tor towards various adversarial strategies.",https://dl.acm.org/ft_gateway.cfm?id=2808152&ftid=1631395&dwn=1&CFID=160953474&CFTOKEN=7c6f91dd74e9b503-1C0ABB46-9DE0-E00D-1937B1AAC1661724,https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2808152&preflayout=flat,4,127,October 2015,Towards Measuring Resilience in Anonymous Communication Networks,WPES '15: Proceedings of the 14th ACM Workshop on Privacy in the Electronic Society

The first attack is a Denial of Service attack that can be executed by injecting only two frames every minute. The second attack demonstrates how fragmentation of 802.11 frames can be used to inject an arbitrary amount of packets, and we show that this can be used to perform a portscan on any client. The third attack enables an attacker to reset the internal state of the Michael algorithm. We show that this can be used to efficiently decrypt arbitrary packets sent towards a client.

625,"Mobile Ad hoc Networks (MANETs) are self-configuring autonomous networks consisting of a set of mobile nodes connected by wireless links. The lack of fixed infrastructure and centralized administration makes it necessary for nodes to cooperate with each other to communicate. However, some nodes may choose to stop forwarding packets intended for others to conserve power, bandwidth, and computational resources. These selfish nodes can have a detrimental impact on the performance of the entire network due to packet loss, denial of service, a decrease in network throughput, and network partitioning. The legacy Ad hoc On-demand Distance Vector (AODV) routing protocol suffers from the inability to mitigate this selfish behavior. In this paper, a new variant of AODV called Reputation-Aware AODV (RAAODV) is proposed and evaluated.

The identification of malign domains is thus necessary to prevent (and react to) incidents. Since malware creators constantly generate new domains to avoid detection, maintaining up-to-date lists of malign domains is challenging. We propose an approach that automatically estimates the risk associated with communicating with a domain based on the data flow behavior of a process communicating with it. Our approach uses unsupervised learning on data flow profiles that capture communication of processes with network endpoints at system call level to distinguish between likely malign or benign behavior. Our evaluations on a large and diverse data set indicate a high detection accuracy and a reasonable performance overhead.

632,"This paper deals with the one of the most prominent attacks on the wireless networks. Since more vulnerable attacks prevail on the wireless networks, the most deadly attack that could even result in financial crisis is the Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks. The DoS attack consumes the bandwidth of the system which is being attacked and stops the services like HTTP, SMTP, FTP, etc. Hence the network under an attacked server cannot access the services provided by the server. Recent news on DoS attacks reveals that the security precautions taken to stop these attacks ended futile.

First, we present a replay attack that allows an on-path attacker to indefinitely stick a broadcast client to a specific time. Second, we present a denial-of-service (DoS) attack that allows an off-path attacker to prevent a broadcast client from ever updating its system clock; to do this, the attacker sends the client a single malformed broadcast packet per query interval. Our DoS attack also applies to all other NTP modes that are `ephemeral' or `preemptable' (including manycast, pool, etc). We then use network measurements to give evidence that NTP's broadcast and other ephemeral/preemptable modes are being used in the wild.

WMNs are becoming a popular choice for wireless internet service providers to offer internet connectivity as it allows a fast, easy and inexpensive network deployment. However, security in WMNs is still in its infancy. Security and privacy has been a major concern in WMNs. WMNs are susceptible to broad variety of attacks due to its open medium, dynamic topology and lack of physical security. WMNs are more vulnerable in Network layer. Several attacks are possible in the network layer. Some of the attacks have possible solutions but there is no solution for to detect Rushing attack which leads to the Denial of Service.

We present a systematic way of designing and verifying such systems with the assumption of bounded drift for local clocks and bounded communication latency.

The RADL paradigm is simple, compositional, and resilient against denial-of-service attacks. Our radler build tool takes the architecture definition and individual local functions as inputs and generate executables for the overall system as output.

674,"Unlike signature or misuse based intrusion detection techniques, anomaly detection is capable of detecting novel attacks. However, the use of anomaly detection in practice is hampered by a high rate of false alarms. Specification-based techniques have been shown to produce a low rate of false alarms, but are not as effective as anomaly detection in detecting novel attacks, especially when it comes to network probing and denial-of-service attacks. This paper presents a new approach that combines specification-based and anomaly-based intrusion detection, mitigating the weaknesses of the two approaches while magnifying their strengths. Our approach begins with state-machine specifications of network protocols, and augments these state machines with information about statistics that need to be maintained to detect anomalies. We present a specification language in which all of this information can be captured in a succinct manner. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach on the 1999 Lincoln Labs intrusion detection evaluation data, where we are able to detect all of the probing and denial-of-service attacks with a low rate of false alarms (less than 10 per day). Whereas feature selection was a crucial step that required a great deal of expertise and insight in the case of previous anomaly detection approaches, we show that the use of protocol specifications in our approach simplifies this problem. Moreover, the machine learning component of our approach is robust enough to operate without human supervision, and fast enough that no sampling techniques need to be employed.

676,"Network firewalls have played a crucial role in reducing unwanted traffic by blocking unsolicited incoming data. However, for many new environments, (such as in peer-to-peer networks and certain new scenarios where wireless terminals act as servers) not all unsolicited data can be blocked. In wireline networks, this problem can partially be solved by opening dedicated pinholes in the network firewalls to allow unsolicited packets to pass. In cellular and wireless networks, however, opening dedicated pinholes can lead to new forms of denial of service (DoS) attacks that are not seen in wireline networks. For example, an attacker can send undesired data through the pinhole and consume the costly radio resources for which the mobile user will have to pay. By flooding the victim with undesired traffic, the attacker can also drain the battery power of the mobile device. Therefore, in these cases, firewalls can neither simply block all unsolicited traffic nor simply open dedicated pin-holes. In this paper, we describe a mechanism by which a firewall can allow unsolicited TCP traffic to reach a mobile device and yet protect the mobile from the DoS attacks described above.

677,"In global mobile network, it is essential to authenticate mobile users and provide secure communication between a user, foreign agent and the home agent using session key. Designing a secure and efficient authentication protocol for roaming users in mobile network is a challenging. The authors wen et al. analyzed Jiang et al. authentication scheme recently and proved that the scheme cannot resist with replay attack and stolen-verifier attack. Later, they come up with a smart card based authentication scheme for roaming service. The Wen et al.'s scheme protects anonymity of the user and is believed to have many abilities to resist a various kind of cryptographic attacks.

679,"In an ad hoc wireless network where wired infrastructures are not feasible, energy and bandwidth conservation are the two key elements presenting challenges to researchers. Limited bandwidth makes a network easily congested by the control signals of the routing protocol. Routing schemes developed for wired networks seldom consider restrictions of this type. Instead, they assume that the network is mostly stable and that the overhead for routing messages is negligible. Considering these differences between wired and wireless network, it is necessary to develop a wireless routing protocol that limits congestion in the network [1, 5, 8, 9, 10, 11].This paper proposes minor modifications to the existing Ad hoc On Demand Vector (AODV) routing protocol (RFC 3561) in order to restrict congestion in networks during a particular type of Denial of Service (DoS) attack. In addition to this, it incurs absolutely no additional overhead [4]. We describe the DoS attack caused due to Route Request (RREQ) flooding and its implications on existing AODV-driven Mobile Ad hoc Networks (MANET) [2, 14]. To combat this DoS attack, a proactive scheme [12] is proposed. We present an illustration to describe the implications of RREQ flooding on pure AODV and the modified AODV protocols. To quantify the effectiveness of the proposed scheme, we simulated a DoS [6] attack in a mobile environment and study the performance results.",https://dl.acm.org/http://xrds.acm.org/article.cfm?aid=1031864,https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1031864&preflayout=flat,3,257,September 2004,A distributed security scheme for ad hoc networks,"XRDS: Crossroads, The ACM Magazine for Students: Volume 11 Issue 1, September 2004"
680,"Botnets are the most common vehicle of cyber-criminal activity. They are used for spamming, phishing, denial-of-service attacks, brute-force cracking, stealing private information, and cyber warfare. Botnets carry out network scans for several reasons, including searching for vulnerable machines to infect and recruit into the botnet, probing networks for enumeration or penetration, etc. We present the measurement and analysis of a horizontal scan of the entire IPv4 address space conducted by the Sality botnet in February 2011. This 12-day scan originated from approximately 3 million distinct IP addresses and used a heavily coordinated and unusually covert scanning strategy to try to discover and compromise VoIP-related (SIP server) infrastructure. We observed this event through the UCSD Network Telescope, a /8 darknet continuously receiving large amounts of unsolicited traffic, and we correlate this traffic data with other public sources of data to validate our inferences. Sality is one of the largest botnets ever identified by researchers. Its behavior represents ominous advances in the evolution of modern malware: the use of more sophisticated stealth scanning strategies by millions of coordinated bots, targeting critical voice communications infrastructure. This paper offers a detailed dissection of the botnet's scanning behavior, including general methods to correlate, visualize, and extrapolate botnet behavior across the global Internet",https://dl.acm.org/ft_gateway.cfm?id=2816998&ftid=1615152&dwn=1&CFID=160953474&CFTOKEN=7c6f91dd74e9b503-1C0ABB46-9DE0-E00D-1937B1AAC1661724,https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2816998&preflayout=flat,2,178,April 2015,"Analysis of a ""/0"" stealth scan from a botnet","IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking (TON): Volume 23 Issue 2, April 2015"
681,"DNS is the canonical protocol for connectionless UDP. Yet DNS today is challenged by eavesdropping that compromises privacy, source-address spoofing that results in denial-of-service (DoS) attacks on the server and third parties, injection attacks that exploit fragmentation, and size limitations that constrain policy and operational choices. We propose T-DNS to address these problems. It uses TCP to smoothly support large payloads and to mitigate spoofing and amplification for DoS. T-DNS uses transport-layer security (TLS) to provide privacy from users to their DNS resolvers and optionally to authoritative servers. Our model shows end-to-end latency from TLS to the recursive resolver is only about 9% slower when UDP is used to the authoritative server, and 22% slower with TCP to the authoritative. With diverse traces we show that frequent connection reuse is possible (60-95% for stub and recursive resolvers, although half that for authoritative servers). Our experiment shows that after connection establishment, TCP and TLS latency is equivalent to UDP. With conservative timeouts (20 s at authoritative servers and 60 s elsewhere) and conservative estimates of connection state memory requirements, we show that server memory requirements well within current, commodity server hardware. We identify the key design and implementation decisions needed to minimize overhead: query pipelining, out-of-order responses, TLS connection resumption, and plausible timeouts.

The operator needs to determine the diversion rule installation and elimination in the networks, as well as the scrubbing resource activation and revocation in the SCs, while minimizing the long-term cost and the cumulative decision-switching penalty without knowing the exact amount of the malicious traffic. We model and formulate this problem as an online nonlinear integer program. In contrast to many other online problems where future inputs are unknown but at least current inputs are known, a key new challenge here is that even part of the current inputs are unknown when decisions are made. To ""learn"" the best decisions online, we transform our problem via a gap-preserving approximation into an online optimization problem with only the known inputs, which is further relaxed and decoupled into a series of one-shot convex programs solvable in individual time slots. To overcome the intractability, we design a progressive rounding algorithm to convert fractional decisions into integral ones without violating the constraints.

This reveals new fingerprinting techniques, multiple downgrade attacks, and Denial of Service (DoS) vulnerabilities. Stations use the Wi-Fi handshake to securely connect with wireless networks. In this handshake, mutually supported capabilities are determined, and fresh pairwise keys are negotiated. As a result, a proper implementation of the Wi-Fi handshake is essential in protecting all subsequent traffic. To detect the presence of erroneous behaviour, we propose a model-based technique that generates a set of representative test cases. These tests cover all states of the Wi-Fi handshake, and explore various edge cases in each state. We then treat the implementation under test as a black box, and execute all generated tests. Determining whether a failed test introduces a security weakness is done manually. We tested 12 implementations using this approach, and discovered irregularities in all of them.

The goal is to achieve a high security level without modifying standard DCS premises or increasing the network overhead. This means we just use the messages an operations already defined by DCS solutions. Our goal is to fulfil two security requirements: (i) only legitimate nodes for an application should be able to access the information of that application, and (ii) avoid long-term Denial of Service attacks targeting an application that operates in the network. Toward this end we define two different solutions depending on whether the sensor nodes in the network are resource-limited or powerful. We run extensive simulations and discuss the efficiency of the proposed solution under two different DCS solutions: GHT that proposes to use a single and static storage node per application, and STARR-DCS that uses multiple storage nodes per application that in addition change over the time.

Suspicious graph patterns show up in many applications, from Twitter users who buy fake followers, manipulating the social network, to botnet members performing distributed denial of service attacks, disturbing the network traffic graph. We propose a fast and effective method, CatchSync, which exploits two of the tell-tale signs left in graphs by fraudsters: (a) synchronized behavior: suspicious nodes have extremely similar behavior pattern, because they are often required to perform some task together (such as follow the same user); and (b) rare behavior: their connectivity patterns are very different from the majority. We introduce novel measures to quantify both concepts (""synchronicity"" and ""normality"") and we propose a parameter-free algorithm that works on the resulting synchronicity-normality plots. Thanks to careful design, CatchSync has the following desirable properties: (a) it is scalable to large datasets, being linear on the graph size; (b) it is parameter free; and (c) it is side-information-oblivious: it can operate using only the topology, without needing labeled data, nor timing information, etc., while still capable of using side information, if available.

699,"In this paper, we address a key topic in the field of computer networking security which is the detection of black hole nodes in VANETs ""Vehicular Ad Hoc Networks"" that are vulnerable to security attacks due to its infrastructureless nature. The black hole attack is a form of a denial of service attack that makes a gap for data traffic in a VANET. Our solution is suitable for a low density network where each car moves in a straight line and delivers packets to other neighboring cars using a geographic routing protocol. Road side units are placed in the intersection of roads and may accept to transfer packets when a car encounters a problem of packet delivery. The black hole attack is considered at the network layer and each car maintains a trust table in order to evaluate the reliability of neighboring cars. Each sender updates the trust value of each neighbor according to the acknowledgement received by the destination and uses jointly this value with the progress to select the best neighbor.

700,"Emerging Non-Volatile Memories (NVMs) suffer from high and asymmetric read/write current and long write latency which can result in supply noise such as supply voltage droop and ground bounce. The magnitude of supply noise depends on the old data and the new data that is being written (for write operation) or on the stored data (for read operation). In this paper, we show that the adversary can write specific data pattern (that results in deterministic supply noise) in their memory space to launch, i) Denial of Service (DoS) attack (total write failure), and ii) specific polarity fault (i.e., fault injection) attack in victim's memory space sharing the same power rails with the adversary's memory space. These attacks are specifically possible if exhaustive testing of the memory for all patterns, all possible location combinations, all possible parallel read/write conditions are not performed under bit-to-bit process variations and, specified (−10°C to 90°C) and unspecified temperature ranges (i.e., less than -10°C and greater than 90°C). Simulation result indicates that adversary can launch DoS attack on victim's write operation by injecting more than 120mV of supply noise to victim's write location. The adversary can also launch 0 → 1 polarity fault injection attack on victim's write operation by injecting supply noise greater than 50mV but shorter than 120mV to victim's write location.

To avoid system failures during attacks service providers have to integrate counter-measures which have to be tested. This work evaluates a test approach to determine the efficiency of counter-measures to fulfill QoS for Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) based VoIP systems even under attack. The main objective of the approach is the evaluation of service availability of a System Under Test (SUT) during security attacks, e.g., Denial of Service (DoS) attacks. Therefore, a simulated system load based on QoS requirements is combined with different security attacks. The observation of the system is based on black-box testing. By monitoring quality metrics of SIP transactions the behavior of the system is measurable. The concept was realized as a prototype and was evaluated using different VoIP systems. For this, multiple security attacks are integrated to the testing scenarios. The outcome showed that the concept provides sound test results, which reflect the behavior of SIP systems availability under various attacks.

708,"In vehicular ad-hoc networks (VANETs), vehicles exchange position information with their neighbors through periodic beacon messages. In dense areas, a massive number of messages may saturate the network and prevent nodes from acquiring the proper resources to exchange their messages. As the vehicle density increases, the network will be at risk of initiating a denial-of-service attack (DoS) of its own, which will prevent the utilization of beacon messages as intended and affect other critical applications. To resolve such potential threats, adaptive beaconing can adjust a vehicle's beacon rate based on detected signal congestion and traffic conditions. In VANETs, high mobility and rapid change in vehicles' locations present challenges in detecting traffic congestion and providing secure and accurate position information. In this paper, we present a novel approach to sending beacon messages based on neighborhood awareness and road traffic density. The proposed solution also allows authority managements to reduce the number of periodic messages to provide quality of service (QoS) for specific applications and vehicles. Simulation showed network performance improvement and a reduced number of beacon messages in dense areas without compromising the level of awareness that will support QoS provisioning and allow bandwidth availability for critical applications.",https://dl.acm.org/ft_gateway.cfm?id=2387231&ftid=1301001&dwn=1&CFID=160953474&CFTOKEN=7c6f91dd74e9b503-1C0ABB46-9DE0-E00D-1937B1AAC1661724,https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2387231&preflayout=flat,2,221,October 2012,Preventing a DoS threat in vehicular ad-hoc networks using adaptive group beaconing,Q2SWinet '12: Proceedings of the 8h ACM symposium on QoS and security for wireless and mobile networks

710,"The problem of achieving fairness in the allocation of the bandwidth resource on a link shared by multiple flows of traffic has been extensively researched over the last decade. However, with the increasing pervasiveness of optical networking and the occasional trend toward using over-provisioning as the solution to congestion, a router's processor also becomes a critical resource to which, ideally speaking, all competing flows should have fair access. For example, if the network is not fair in allocating processing resources, denial of service attacks based on an excessive use of the router processor (such as by using unnecessary optional headers) become possible. In this paper, we investigate the issue of achieving fairness in the joint allocation of the processing and bandwidth resources. We first present a simple but powerful general principle for defining fairness in such systems based on any of the classic notions of fairness such as max-min fairness, proportional fairness and utility max-min fairness defined for a single resource. We apply our principle to a system with a shared processor and a shared link with max-min fairness as the desired goal. We then propose a practical and provably fair packet-by-packet algorithm for the joint allocation of processing and bandwidth resources. We demonstrate the fairness achieved by our algorithm through simulation results using real gateway traffic traces. The principles and the algorithm detailed in this paper may also be applied in the allocation of other kinds of resources such as power, a critical resource in mobile systems.",https://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81309508774&coll=DL&dl=ACM&trk=0,https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1784045&preflayout=flat,2,n/a,June 2003,On achieving fairness in the joint allocation of processing and bandwidth resources,IWQoS'03: Proceedings of the 11th international conference on Quality of service

RIVALS will focus on peer-to-peer networks and use coevolutionary algorithms. In this contribution, we describe RIVALS' current suite of coevolutionary algorithms that use archiving to maintain progressive exploration and that support different solution concepts as fitness metrics. We compare and contrast their effectiveness by executing a standard coevolutionary benchmark (Compare-on-one) and RIVALS simulations on 3 different network topologies. Currently, we model denial of service (DOS) attack strategies by the attacker selecting one or more network servers to disable for some duration. Defenders can choose one of three different network routing protocols: shortest path, flooding and a peer-to-peer ring overlay to try to maintain their performance. Attack completion and resource cost minimization serve as attacker objectives. Mission completion and resource cost minimization are the reciprocal defender objectives. Our experiments show that existing algorithms either sacrifice execution speed or forgo the assurance of consistent results. rIPCA, our adaptation of a known coevolutionary algorithm named IPC A, is able to more consistently produce high quality results, albeit without IPCA's guarantees for results with monotonically increasing performance, without sacrificing speed.",https://dl.acm.org/ft_gateway.cfm?id=3076081&ftid=1893962&dwn=1&CFID=160953474&CFTOKEN=7c6f91dd74e9b503-1C0ABB46-9DE0-E00D-1937B1AAC1661724,https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3076081&preflayout=flat,3,145,July 2017,Investigating coevolutionary archive based genetic algorithms on cyber defense networks,GECCO '17: Proceedings of the Genetic and Evolutionary Computation Conference Companion
714,"In this demo, we will show the effects of multiple Bluetooth Low Energy spoofing attacks, including a novel cache poisoning attack. Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) is often used for communication between devices, ranging from headphones to medical sensors. Our attacks target the BLE advertising mechanism to cause Denial of Service and Man-in-the-Middle conditions. BLE Peripheral Devices are discovered through an advertising process, in which the Peripheral broadcasts advertising packets to listening Central Devices. Such packets typically include the advertising address of the device, name of the device, and information about the connectability of the device. Peripheral Devices are generally assumed to have distinct advertising addresses. If a device advertises with the same address as another device, Central Devices need to decide which information is correct. We term the condition where advertisements contain contradictory information a ""Disputed Advertisement"". In the case where an advertisement contains optional information, there may be a condition where one of the packets contains maliciously included information, but is not contradicted by a legitimate packet. We call this condition an ""Undisputed Advertisement"", which is the basis for a novel attack that we call Bluestaking. The Bluestaking attack poisons advertising name cache on Central Devices with attacker-selected address-to-name mappings. Because BLE devices are not required to be named, an attacker can spoof a device and provide a name without any dispute from the victim device. This causes scanning Central Devices to cache the name indefinitely.",https://dl.acm.org/ft_gateway.cfm?id=3326321&ftid=2059141&dwn=1&CFID=160953474&CFTOKEN=7c6f91dd74e9b503-1C0ABB46-9DE0-E00D-1937B1AAC1661724,https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3326321&preflayout=flat,0,41,May 2019,Using bluetooth low energy spoofing to dispute device details: demo,WiSec '19: Proceedings of the 12th Conference on Security and Privacy in Wireless and Mobile Networks

717,"To match the signatures of malicious traffic across packet boundaries, network-intrusion detection (and prevention) systems (NIDS) typically perform pattern matching after flow reassembly or packet reordering. However, this may lead to the need for large packet buffers, making detection vulnerable to denial-of-service (DoS) attacks, whereby attackers exhaust the buffer capacity by sending long sequences of out-of-order packets. While researchers have proposed solutions for exact-match patterns, regular-expression matching on out-of-order packets is still an open problem. Specifically, a key challenge is the matching of complex sub-patterns (such as repetitions of wildcards matched at the boundary between packets). Our proposed approach leverages the insight that various segments matching the same repetitive sub-pattern are logically equivalent to the regular-expression matching engine, and thus, inter-changing them would not affect the final result. In this paper, we present O3FA, a new finite automata-based, deep packet-inspection engine to perform regular-expression matching on out-of-order packets without requiring flow reassembly. O3FA consists of a deterministic finite automaton (FA) coupled with a set of prefix-/suffix-FA, which allows processing out-of-order packets on the fly. We present our design, optimization, and evaluation for the O3FA engine.

These protocols enable doctors to carry out critical functions, such as changing the IMD's therapy or collecting telemetry data, without having to perform surgery on the patient.

For this we follow a black-box reverse-engineering approach and use inexpensive Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) equipment. We demonstrate that reverse-engineering is feasible by a weak adversary who has limited resources and capabilities without physical access to the devices. Our analysis of the proprietary protocol results in the identification of several protocol and implementation weaknesses. Unlike previous studies, which found no security measures, this article discovers the first known attempt to obfuscate the data that is transmitted over the air. Furthermore, we conduct privacy and Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks and give evidence of other attacks that can compromise the patient's safety. All these attacks can be performed without needing to be in close proximity to the patient. We validate that our findings apply to (at least) 10 types of ICDs that are currently on the market.

In both DoS attacks and flash crowds the congestion is due neither to a single flow, nor to a general increase in traffic, but to a well-defined subset of the traffic --- an ",https://dl.acm.org/ft_gateway.cfm?id=571724&ftid=83385&dwn=1&CFID=160953474&CFTOKEN=7c6f91dd74e9b503-1C0ABB46-9DE0-E00D-1937B1AAC1661724,https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=571724&preflayout=flat,171,"1,731",July 2002,Controlling high bandwidth aggregates in the network,"ACM SIGCOMM Computer Communication Review: Volume 32 Issue 3, July 2002"

With the widely spreading in such technology many counters attaches tried to apply different counter measure. In this paper we tried to build a counter countermeasure which increases the security of specific messages by performing a complicated three security stages. These stages are; embedding the selected voice into RGB image, hidden the image in voice signal and perform data integrity using real time protocol (RTP). Following such a proposed algorithm, the process of eavesdrop or counter attacks will not be able to break such a multi-layer security process. In this paper, we propose an Adaptive VoIP steganography approach to hide the audio information within images to enhance the security of the voice communications.

722,"Software defined networking SDN is a new networking paradigm that in recent years has revolutionized network architectures. At its core, SDN separates the data plane, which provides data forwarding functionalities, and the control plane, which implements the network control logic. The separation of these two components provides a virtually centralized point of control in the network, and at the same time abstracts the complexity of the underlying physical infrastructure. Unfortunately, while promising, the SDN approach also introduces new attacks and vulnerabilities. Indeed, previous research shows that, under certain traffic conditions, the required communication between the control and data plane can result in a bottleneck. An attacker can exploit this limitation to mount a new, network-wide, type of denial of service attack, known as the ",https://dl.acm.org/ft_gateway.cfm?id=3105617&ftid=1879453&dwn=1&CFID=160953474&CFTOKEN=7c6f91dd74e9b503-1C0ABB46-9DE0-E00D-1937B1AAC1661724,https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3105617&preflayout=flat,0,60,April 2017,LineSwitch: Tackling Control Plane Saturation Attacks in Software-Defined Networking,"IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking (TON): Volume 25 Issue 2, April 2017"

In swarm scenarios where the concept for the teams of robots requires performing cooperative tasks, robots need to be enforced to communicate with each other in the background while executing specific collaborative missions. In order to achieve complex tasks in real-time beyond their individual capability, multi-robot systems (MRS) require a stable, sustained and secure stream of data exchange. Typically, this technique also requires an approach of communication and synchronization among the robots known as swarm R2R (robot to robot) communication in real time [1].

In this paper we begin by showing that system metrics generated by many modern information systems like Twitter, Wikipedia, YouTube and GitHub obey this law. We then propose a novel unsupervised approach called BenFound that exploits this property to detect anomalous system events. BenFound tracks the ""Benfordness"" of key system metrics, like the follower counts of tweeting Twitter users or the change deltas in Wikipedia page edits. It then applies a novel Benford-conformity test in real-time to identify ""non-Benford events"". We investigate a variety of such events, showing that they correspond to unnatural and often undesirable system interactions like spamming, hashtag-hijacking and denial-of-service attacks.

Its lack of security mechanisms led to a high number of attacks and consequently several security countermeasures were proposed, i.e., authentication protocols or intrusion detection mechanisms. We discuss vulnerabilities of the CAN data link layer that can be triggered from the application level with the use of an off the shelf CAN transceiver. Namely, due to the wired-AND design of the CAN bus, dominant bits will always overwrite recessive ones, a functionality normally used to assure priority for frames with low value identifiers. We exploit this characteristic and show Denial of Service attacks both on senders and receivers based on bit injections by using bit banging to maliciously control the CAN transceiver. We demonstrate the effects and limitations of such attacks through experimental analysis and discuss possible countermeasures.

However, recent studies have shown the promises of guessing user passwords efficiently with auxiliary information of the targeted accounts, such as the users' personal information, previously used passwords, or those used in other systems. Authentication rate-limiting mechanisms, such as account lockout and login throttling, are common methods to defeat online password cracking attacks. But to date, no published studies have investigated how authentication rate-limiting is implemented by popular websites. In this paper, we present a measurement study of such countermeasures against online password cracking. Towards this end, we propose a black-box approach to modeling and validating the websites' implementation of the rate-limiting mechanisms. We applied the tool to examine all 182 websites that we were able to analyze in the Alexa Top 500 websites in the United States. The results are rather surprising: 131 websites (72%) allow frequent, unsuccessful login attempts without account lockout or login throttling (though some of these websites force the adversary to lower the login frequency or constantly change his IP addresses to circumvent the rate-limiting enforcement). The remaining 51 websites are not absolutely secure either: 28 websites may block a legitimate user with correct passwords when the account is locked out, effectively enabling authentication denial-of-service attacks.",https://dl.acm.org/ft_gateway.cfm?id=3274714&ftid=2022442&dwn=1&CFID=160953474&CFTOKEN=7c6f91dd74e9b503-1C0ABB46-9DE0-E00D-1937B1AAC1661724,https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3274714&preflayout=flat,1,380,December 2018,A Measurement Study of Authentication Rate-Limiting Mechanisms of Modern Websites,ACSAC '18: Proceedings of the 34th Annual Computer Security Applications Conference

733,"Today, tiny embedded Internet of Things (IoT) devices are increasingly used in safety- and privacy-critical application scenarios. In many of these scenarios, devices perform a certain task collectively as a swarm. Remote attestation is an important cornerstone for the security of these IoT devices, as it allows to verify the integrity of the software on remote devices. Recently proposed collective attestation protocols are able to attest entire device swarms in an efficient way. However, these protocols are inefficient or even inapplicable when devices in the network are mobile or lack continuous connectivity. This work presents SALAD, the first collective attestation protocol for highly dynamic and disruptive networks. SALAD uses a novel distributed approach, where devices incrementally establish a common view on the integrity of all devices in the network. In contrast to existing protocols, SALAD performs well in highly dynamic and disruptive network topologies, increases resilience against targeted Denial of Service (DoS) attacks, and allows to obtain the attestation result from any device. Moreover, SALAD is capable of mitigating physical attacks in an efficient manner, which is achieved by adapting and extending recently proposed aggregation schemes.

734,"With the increase in number of hosts in the Internet, there is also a rise in the demand for IP address space. To cater to this issue, IP version 6 (IPv6) succeeded IPv4. Compared to 32 bit IP address space in IPv4, IP address in IPv6 is composed of 128 bits. In IPv4, when a host wants to communicate with another host in an LAN, it needs to know the MAC address of the target host, which was possible through Address Resolution Protocol (ARP). As ARP is stateless and due to lack of authorization in ARP messages, many attacks like request spoofing, response spoofing, Man-in-the-Middle (MiTM), Denial-of- Service (DoS) etc. are possible. IPv6 uses Network Discovery Protocol (NDP) to find the MAC address. NDP is also stateless and lacks authentication of its messages by default. So NDP also suffers from many attacks similar to ARP.

It is intended as a replacement for the TLS/TCP stack and will be the basis of HTTP/3, the next official version of the hypertext transfer protocol. As a result, it is likely, in the near future, to carry a substantial fraction of traffic on the Internet. We describe our experience applying a methodology of compositional specification-based testing to QUIC. We develop a formal specification of the wire protocol, and use this specification to generate automated randomized testers for implementations of QUIC. The testers effectively take one role of the QUIC protocol, interacting with the other role to generate full protocol executions, and verifying that the implementations conform to the formal specification. This form of testing generates significantly more diverse stimuli and stronger correctness criteria than interoperability testing, the primary method used to date to validate QUIC and its implementations.

Because all of the nodes communicate each other based on the routing protocol, and an attacker could manipulate a lower-level protocol to interrupt a security mechanism in a higher-level one, securing routing protocol is an important issue in MANETs. Recently, there exist several proposals that attempt to architect a secure routing protocol for MANETs. Ariadne is the flagship protocol for securing the dynamic source routing protocol, and it can defend against the alteration of route message and prevent various types of Denial of Service attacks. Unfortunately, in 2006 Acs et al. stated Ariadne will suffer from a new attack, and proposed a provably secure on-demand source routing protocol, called ENDAIRA, against such an attack. However, their method is not actually secure against the Sybil and wormhole attacks.

JellyFish attack exploits the behavior of closed loop protocols such as TCP and performs the attacks without disobeying any rules of the protocol. Consequently, it causes ruinous effects and becomes difficult to detect due to its protocol compliance nature. This paper provides the complete simulation study of JellyFish attacks on three TCP variants known as TCP-Tahoe, TCP-SACK and TCP-NewReno. The simulations have been taken in the light of throughput, number of JF nodes and number of retransmissions. The paper contributes to the field of denial of service (DoS) attacks in MANETs by giving a comparative analysis of three TCP variants and discovers which TCP variant performs best under different variants of JellyFish attack.

Faults may exist in complex policies for various reasons such as misunderstanding of the access control requirements, omissions, and coding errors. These faults, if not removed before deployment, may lead to unauthorized accesses or denial of service. Manual localization of these faults, however, can be a challenging task. Inspired by spectrum-based fault localization for software debugging, this paper presents an approach for automatically localizing the fault(s) in a given XACML policy by exploring test coverage information of the policy elements. We investigate two test coverage criteria (i.e., reachability and firing) of policy elements and 14 scoring methods for ranking policy elements to determine the fault location(s).

742,"As DNS packet are mostly UDP-based, make it as a perfect tool for hackers to launch a well-known type of distributed denial of service (DDoS). The purpose of this attack is to saturate the DNS server availability and resources. This type of attack usually utilizes a large number of botnet and perform spoofing on the IP address of the targeted victim. We take a different approach for IP spoofing detection and mitigation strategies to protect the DNS server by utilizing Software Defined Networking (SDN). In this paper, we present CAuth, a novel mechanism that autonomously block the spoofing query packet while authenticate the legitimate query. By manipulating Openflow control message, we design a collaborative approach between client and server network. Whenever a server controller receives query packet, it will send an authentication packet back to the client network and later the client controller also replies via authentication packet back to the server controller. The server controller will only forward the query to the DNS server if it receives the replied authentication packet from the client. From the evaluation, CAuth instantly manage to block spoofing query packet while authenticate the legitimate query as soon as the mechanism started. Most notably, our mechanism designed with no changes in existing DNS application and Openflow protocol.",https://dl.acm.org/ft_gateway.cfm?id=2935666&ftid=1741544&dwn=1&CFID=160953474&CFTOKEN=7c6f91dd74e9b503-1C0ABB46-9DE0-E00D-1937B1AAC1661724,https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2935666&preflayout=flat,0,251,June 2016,Protecting DNS services from IP spoofing: SDN collaborative authentication approach,CFI '16: Proceedings of the 11th International Conference on Future Internet Technologies

However, the significant resource consumption imposed by public key cryptographic operations makes such mechanisms easy targets of Denial- of Service (DoS) attacks. For example, if digital signatures such as ECDSA are used directly for broadcast authentication without further protection, an attacker can simply broadcast forged packets and force the receiving nodes to perform a large number of unnecessary signature verifications, eventually exhausting their battery power.

744,"We motivate the capability approach to network denial-of-service (DoS) attacks, and evaluate the Traffic Validation Architecture (TVA) architecture which builds on capabilities. With our approach, rather than send packets to any destination at any time, senders must first obtain ""permission to send"" from the receiver, which provides the permission in the form of capabilities to those senders whose traffic it agrees to accept. The senders then include these capabilities in packets. This enables verification points distributed around the network to check that traffic has been authorized by the receiver and the path in between, and hence to cleanly discard unauthorized traffic. To evaluate this approach, and to understand the detailed operation of capabilities, we developed a network architecture called TVA. TVA addresses a wide range of possible attacks against communication between pairs of hosts, including spoofed packet floods, network and host bottlenecks, and router state exhaustion. We use simulations to show the effectiveness of TVA at limiting DoS floods, and an implementation on Click router to evaluate the computational costs of TVA.

745,"While the standard language XACML is very expressive for specifying fine-grained access control policies, defects can get into XACML policies for various reasons, such as misunderstanding of access control requirements, omissions, and coding errors. These defects may result in unauthorized accesses, escalation of privileges, and denial of service. Therefore, quality assurance of XACML policies for real-world information systems has become an important issue. To address this issue, this paper presents a family of coverage criteria for XACML policies, such as rule coverage, rule pair coverage, decision coverage, and Modified Condition/Decision Coverage (MC/DC). To demonstrate the assurance levels of these coverage criteria, we have developed methods for automatically generating tests, i.e., access requests, to satisfy the coverage criteria using a constraint solver. We have evaluated these methods through mutation analysis of various policies with different levels of complexity. The experiment results have shown that the rule coverage is far from adequate for revealing the majority of defects in XACML policies, and that both MC/DC and decision coverage tests have outperformed the existing methods for testing XACML policies. In particular, MC/DC tests achieve a very high level of quality assurance of XACML policies.",https://dl.acm.org/ft_gateway.cfm?id=3205979&ftid=1979118&dwn=1&CFID=160953474&CFTOKEN=7c6f91dd74e9b503-1C0ABB46-9DE0-E00D-1937B1AAC1661724,https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3205979&preflayout=flat,0,251,June 2018,Automated Coverage-Based Testing of XACML Policies,SACMAT '18: Proceedings of the 23nd ACM on Symposium on Access Control Models and Technologies
746,"Per-flow network traffic measurements are needed for effective network traffic management, network performance assessment, and detection of anomalous network events such as incipient denial-of-service (DoS) attacks. Explicit measurement of per-flow traffic statistics is difficult in backbone networks because tracking the possibly hundreds of thousands of flows needs correspondingly large high-speed memories. To reduce the measurement overhead, many previous papers have proposed the use of random sampling and this is also used in commercial routers (Cisco's NetFlow). Our goal is to develop a new scheme that has very low memory requirements and has quick convergence to within a pre-specified accuracy. We achieve this by use of a novel approach based on sampling two-runs to estimate per-flow traffic. (A flow has a two-run when two consecutive samples belong to the same flow). Sampling two-runs automatically biases the samples towards the larger flows thereby making the estimation of these sources more accurate. This biased sampling leads to significantly smaller memory requirement compared to random sampling schemes. The scheme is very simple to implement and performs extremely well.",https://dl.acm.org/ft_gateway.cfm?id=1373496&ftid=501295&dwn=1&CFID=160953474&CFTOKEN=7c6f91dd74e9b503-1C0ABB46-9DE0-E00D-1937B1AAC1661724,https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1373496&preflayout=flat,3,147,December 2007,"Fast, memory efficient flow rate estimation using runs","IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking (TON): Volume 15 Issue 6, December 2007"

In this paper we present a specialized system that computes multiple summaries of IP traffic in real time and achieves robustness and isolation between tasks in a novel way: by automatically adapting the parameters of the summarization algorithms. In traditional systems, anomalous network behavior such as denial of service attacks or worms can overwhelm the memory or CPU, making the system produce meaningless results exactly when measurement is needed most. In contrast, our measurement system reacts by gracefully degrading the accuracy of the affected summaries.The types of summaries we compute are widely used by network administrators monitoring the workloads of their networks: the ports sending the most traffic, the IP addresses sending or receiving the most traffic or opening the most connections, etc. We evaluate and compare many existing algorithmic solutions for computing these summaries, as well as two new solutions we propose here: ""flow sample and hold"" and ""Bloom filter tuple set counting"".

A wide area pub-sub system is usually implemented on an overlay network infrastructure to enable information dissemination from publishers to subscribers.

However, this potential does not come for free; WSNs have been known to be vulnerable to several types of attacks aiming at compromising their security. Among these types, Denial of Service (DoS) attacks stand out, as most WSNs are vulnerable to such attacks, which affect the routing behavior. This paper introduces a simulation platform, based on the network simulator ns-2, that allows the in-depth study of DoS attacks against WSNs. We simulate and analyze the performance of routing protocols for WSNs using a scenario-based experiment, in order to analyze the network's behavior under all the simulated attacks, namely Blackhole, Flooding, Rushing and Selective Forwarding.

756,"Twitter contains a wealth of timely information, however staying on top of breaking events requires that an information analyst constantly scan many sources, leading to information overload. For example, a user might wish to be made aware whenever an infectious disease outbreak takes place, when a new smartphone is announced or when a distributed Denial of Service (DoS) attack might affect an organization's network connectivity. There are many possible event categories an analyst may wish to track, making it impossible to anticipate all those of interest in advance. We therefore propose a weakly supervised approach, in which extractors for new categories of events are easy to define and train, by specifying a small number of seed examples. We cast seed-based event extraction as a learning problem where only positive and unlabeled data is available. Rather than assuming unlabeled instances are negative, as is common in previous work, we propose a learning objective which regularizes the label distribution towards a user-provided expectation. Our approach greatly outperforms heuristic negatives, used in most previous work, in experiments on real-world data. Significant performance gains are also demonstrated over two novel and competitive baselines: semi-supervised EM and one-class support-vector machines.

In such cases, it reveals little information about the other smaller traffic patterns which may contain interesting yet important information about the traffic. We propose an adaptive sampling technique that utilizes a buffer of frequently seen patterns and a combination of sampling steps to build a hierarchical tree of traffic clusters. We show that this sampling technique ensures that smaller and newer patterns are represented in the cluster tree while satisfying the maximum sampling rate imposed by the resource constraints. This technique has two benefits: it preserves the underlying patterns of the data, and improves efficiency by reducing the sampling of records from known patterns.

In general, given a sequence of weighted, directed or bipartite graphs, each summarizing a snapshot of activity in a time window, how can we spot anomalous graphs containing the sudden appearance or disappearance of large dense subgraphs (e.g., near bicliques) in near real-time using sublinear memory? To this end, we propose a randomized sketching-based approach called SpotLight, which guarantees that an anomalous graph is mapped 'far' away from 'normal' instances in the sketch space with high probability for appropriate choice of parameters. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets show that SpotLight (a) improves accuracy by at least 8.4% compared to prior approaches, (b) is fast and can process millions of edges within a few minutes, (c) scales linearly with the number of edges and sketching dimensions and (d) leads to interesting discoveries in practice.",https://dl.acm.org/ft_gateway.cfm?id=3220040&ftid=1988901&dwn=1&CFID=160953474&CFTOKEN=7c6f91dd74e9b503-1C0ABB46-9DE0-E00D-1937B1AAC1661724,https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3220040&preflayout=flat,0,"2,098",July 2018,SpotLight: Detecting Anomalies in Streaming Graphs,KDD '18: Proceedings of the 24th ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery & Data Mining
764,"Consider sounds, say at 40kHz, that are completely outside the human's audible range (20kHz), as well as a microphone's recordable range (24kHz). We show that these high frequency sounds can be designed to become recordable by unmodified microphones, while remaining inaudible to humans. The core idea lies in exploiting non-linearities in microphone hardware. Briefly, we design the sound and play it on a speaker such that, after passing through the microphone's non-linear diaphragm and power-amplifier, the signal creates a ""shadow"" in the audible frequency range. The shadow can be regulated to carry data bits, thereby enabling an acoustic (but inaudible) communication channel to today's microphones. Other applications include jamming spy microphones in the environment, live watermarking of music in a concert, and even acoustic denial-of-service (DoS) attacks.

However, liberal arts colleges rarely have the resources needed to provide the hands-on labs critical to attracting students to cyber security classes and for preparing students for the workforce. Our NSF funded project 'CyberPaths"" addresses this by devising several active learning labs on topics such as ransomware, authentication, Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS), and remote network attacks. These labs are implemented on the cloud infrastructure GENI, an NSF funded free academic cloud infrastructure for realistic networking experimentation. We have developed a variety of labs that are suitable for non-CS majors as well as CS upper level courses. In addition, we propose interdisciplinary cyber security modules and multiple paths that can lead to the cyber security professions, starting from the general education courses, moving to an intro to cyber security course, and upper level CS courses. Our goal is to offer solutions to liberal arts institutions with cyber security active learning and introducing cyber security early in the curriculum with low overhead.

776,"In the context of autonomic environment, we present a simple yet, effective Danger Theory based method to detect TCP SYN Flooding attack. An autonomous communication network consists of self-managed (i.e. self-configuring, self-awareness, self-optimization, self-healing and self-protection, collectively denoted as self-*) entities. These self-* properties ensure functioning of the network without or very minimum human intervention. In such an environment, security of the system is very challenging as there is no dedicated authority to monitor malicious activities and each entity, the computing device, has to monitor itself. Denial of service (DoS) attack, in particular flooding attack, is one of the most frequent and devastating attacks on networks. Traditionally, the detection of flooding attacks is achieved by a network-based intrusion detection system (IDS), mainly relying on the statistical characteristics of network data with fine tuning from a human administrator by monitoring the traffic continuously. Obviously, such facility is not assumed in autonomic networks. We, therefore, propose a danger theory based approach that can detect DoS attack in an automatic manner. The proposed scheme is able to detect SYN flood attack in its early stage, thereby enabling to control the damage. To empirically validate our proposal, we conduct experiments in a simulated environment and the results are encouraging.

777,"Automated programs (bots) are responsible for a large percentage of website traffic. These bots can either be used for benign purposes, such as Web indexing, Website monitoring (validation of hyperlinks and HTML code), feed fetching Web content and data extraction for commercial use or for malicious ones, including, but not limited to, content scraping, vulnerability scanning, account takeover, distributed denial of service attacks, marketing fraud, carding and spam. To ensure their security, Web servers try to identify bot sessions and apply special rules to them, such as throttling their requests or delivering different content. The methods currently used for the identification of bots are based either purely on rule-based bot detection techniques or a combination of rule-based and machine learning techniques. While current research has developed highly adequate methods for Web bot detection, these methods' adequacy when faced with Web bots that try to remain undetected hasn't been studied. For this reason, we created and evaluated a Web bot detection framework on its ability to detect conspicuous bots separately from its ability to detect advanced Web bots. We assessed the proposed framework performance using real HTTP traffic from a public Web server. Our experimental results show that the proposed framework has significant ability to detect Web bots that do not try to hide their bot identity using HTTP Web logs (balanced accuracy in a false-positive intolerant server > 95%).

778,"With the increasing number of nodes, connecting on the same link needs a distinct Internet protocol (IP) address for each node. Duplicate address detection (DAD) is the process responsible for verifying the uniqueness of the IP address on the same link by using two neighbor discovery protocol (NDP) messages, namely, neighbor solicitation and neighbor advertisement. Given that NDP messages are unsecured by their design, any node can manipulate these messages and launch a denial of service (DoS) attack. This attack on DAD prevents legitimate node from configuring its IP address. Many mechanisms have been proposed to address this issue, but they have exhibited side effects, such as complexity and performance degradation. This study proposed a new security technique called DAD-match that relies on cryptographic hash function to hide a tentative IP address during the DAD procedure.

779,"Among the leading reference implementations of the Software Defined Networking (SDN) paradigm is the OpenFlow framework, which decouples the control plane into a centralized application. In this paper, we consider two aspects of OpenFlow that pose security challenges, and we propose two solutions that could address these concerns. The first challenge is the inherent communication bottleneck that arises between the data plane and the control plane, which an adversary could exploit by mounting a ""control plane saturation attack"" that disrupts network operations. Indeed, even well-mined adversarial models, such as scanning or denial-of-service (DoS) activity, can produce more potent impacts on OpenFlow networks than traditional networks. To address this challenge, we introduce an extension to the OpenFlow data plane called ""connection migration"", which dramatically reduces the amount of data-to-control-plane interactions that arise during such attacks. The second challenge is that of enabling the control plane to expedite both detection of, and responses to, the changing flow dynamics within the data plane. For this, we introduce ""actuating triggers"" over the data plane's existing statistics collection services. These triggers are inserted by control layer applications to both register for asynchronous call backs, and insert conditional flow rules that are only activated when a trigger condition is detected within the data plane's statistics module. We present Avant-Guard, an implementation of our two data plane extensions, evaluate the performance impact, and examine its use for developing more scalable and resilient SDN security services.",https://dl.acm.org/ft_gateway.cfm?id=2516684&ftid=1411866&dwn=1&CFID=160953474&CFTOKEN=7c6f91dd74e9b503-1C0ABB46-9DE0-E00D-1937B1AAC1661724,https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2516684&preflayout=flat,60,"2,345",November 2013,AVANT-GUARD: scalable and vigilant switch flow management in software-defined networks,CCS '13: Proceedings of the 2013 ACM SIGSAC conference on Computer & communications security

781,"Denial of service attacks on peer-to-peer (p2p) systems can arise from sources otherwise considered non-malicious. We focus on one such commonly prevalent source, called ""churn"". Churn arises from continued and rapid arrival and failure (or departure) of a large number of participants in the system, and traces from deployments have shown that it can lead to extremely stressful networking conditions. It has the potential to increase host loads and block a large fraction of normal insert and lookup operations in the peer-to-peer system. This paper studies a cooperative web caching system that is resistant to churn attacks. Based on the Kelips peer-to-peer routing substrate, it imposes a constant load on participants and is able to reorganize itself continuously under churn. Peer pointers are automatically established among more available participants, thus ensuring high cache hit rates even when the system is stressed under churn. In addition, the system improves on the network locality of cache accesses in previous web caching schemes.

782,"Malwares pose a grave threat to security of a network and host systems. Many events such as Distributed Denial-of-Service attacks, spam emails etc., often have malwares as their root cause. So a great deal of research is being invested in detection and removal of malwares. Thus many malware detection systems or antivirus softwares have come up. But the drawback of these antivirus softwares is they rely upon signature matching approach for malware detection which can be easily defeated using simple code obfuscation techniques. This has given rise to a new generation of metamorphic and polymorphic malwares. In this paper we proposed the approach of monitoring interdependent system calls to detect obfuscated malicious programs. We took some sample malwares and some common obfuscation techniques.

783,"Complex traffic networks include a number of controlled intersections, and, commonly, multiple districts or municipalities. The result is that the overall traffic control problem is extremely complex computationally. Moreover, given that different municipalities may have distinct, non-aligned, interests, traffic light controller design is inherently decentralized, a consideration that is almost entirely absent from related literature. Both complexity and decentralization have great bearing both on the quality of the traffic network overall, as well as on its security. We consider both of these issues in a dynamic traffic network. First, we propose an effective local search algorithm to efficiently design system-wide control logic for a collection of intersections. Second, we propose a game theoretic (Stackelberg game) model of traffic network security in which an attacker can deploy denial-of-service attacks on sensors, and develop a resilient control algorithm to mitigate such threats. Finally, we propose a game theoretic model of decentralization, and investigate this model both in the context of baseline traffic network design, as well as resilient design accounting for attacks. Our methods are implemented and evaluated using a simple traffic network scenario in SUMO.",https://dl.acm.org/ft_gateway.cfm?id=2898384&ftid=1708302&dwn=1&CFID=160953474&CFTOKEN=7c6f91dd74e9b503-1C0ABB46-9DE0-E00D-1937B1AAC1661724,https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2898384&preflayout=flat,1,57,April 2016,Decentralization and security in dynamic traffic light control,HotSos '16: Proceedings of the Symposium and Bootcamp on the Science of Security

785,"Dynamic linking has many advantages for managing large code bases, but dynamically linked applications have not typically scaled well on high performance computing systems. Splitting a monolithic executable into many dynamic shared object (DSO) files decreases compile time for large codes, reduces runtime memory requirements by allowing modules to be loaded and unloaded as needed, and allows common DSOs to be shared among many executables. However, launching an executable that depends on many DSOs causes a flood of file system operations at program start-up, when each process in the parallel application loads its dependencies. At large scales, this operation has an effect similar to a site-wide denial-of-service attack, as even large parallel file systems struggle to service so many simultaneous requests. In this paper, we present SPINDLE, a novel approach to parallel loading that coordinates simultaneous file system operations with a scalable network of cache server processes. Our approach is transparent to user applications. We extend the GNU loader, which is used in Linux as well as proprietary operating systems, to limit the number of simultaneous file system operations, quickly loading DSOs without thrashing the file system. Our experiments show that our prototype implementation has a low overhead and increases the scalability of Pynamic, a benchmark that stresses the dynamic loader, by a factor of 20.",https://dl.acm.org/ft_gateway.cfm?id=2465020&ftid=1374762&dwn=1&CFID=160953474&CFTOKEN=7c6f91dd74e9b503-1C0ABB46-9DE0-E00D-1937B1AAC1661724,https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2465020&preflayout=flat,4,151,June 2013,Massively parallel loading,ICS '13: Proceedings of the 27th international ACM conference on International conference on supercomputing

A system and a multi-core architecture to defend from these algorithmic complexity attacks is presented in the second part of the paper. The integration of this system with two different DPI engines is demonstrated and discussed. The vulnerability is exposed by showing how a simple low bandwidth cache-miss attack takes down the Aho-Corasick AC pattern matching algorithm that lies at the heart of most DPI engines. As a first step in the mitigation of the attack, we have developed a compressed variant of the AC algorithm that improves the worst case performance under an attack.

While most prior studies examined the impact of security breach announcements on the United States? market reaction, our study examines the South Korean market's reaction to similar events. Investor protection theory suggests that different markets react differently to similar events. Specifically stronger investor protection leads to lower information asymmetry, which in turn results in a more efficient market valuation. Korea's investor protection index is lower than that of the U.S., suggesting higher information asymmetry and less efficient market valuation. Our study found that the Korean market reaction to cyber incidents was relatively slow, supporting the above assertion. In addition, regulated industries experienced significant negative abnormal returns post-2007 when privacy laws were enacted in South Korea. The study also found that Korea?s market reaction to security incident announcements varied over time as the nature of cyber attacks and attackers changed.

Technologies of Internet governance increasingly mediate freedom of expression and individual privacy. They are entangled with national security and global commerce. The distributed nature of Internet governance technologies is shifting historic control over these public interest areas from sovereign nation-states to private ordering and new global institutions. The term ""Internet governance"" conjures up a host of global controversies such as the prolonged Internet outage in Syria during political turmoil or Google's decision not to acquiesce to U.S. government requests to remove an incendiary political video from YouTube. It invokes narratives about the United Nations ""taking over"" the Internet, NSA surveillance revelations, cybersecurity concerns about denial of service attacks, and the mercurial privacy policies of social media companies. These issues exist only at the surface of a technologically concealed and institutionally complex ecosystem of governance that is generally out of public view.

This paper presents an empirical study of bogon route announcements, as observed at eight vantage points on the Internet. On average, we observe several bogon routes leaked every few days; a small number of ASes also temporarily leak hundreds of bogon routes. About 40% of these bogon routes are not withdrawn for at least a day. We observed 110 different ASes originating routes for bogon prefixes and a few ASes that were responsible for advertising a disproportionate number of these routes. We also find that some ASes that do filter unallocated prefixes continue to filter them for as long as five months after they have been allocated, mistakenly filtering valid routes. Both of these types of delinquencies have serious implications: the failure to filter valid prefixes can could make nefarious activities such as denial of service attacks difficult to trace; failure to update filters when new prefixes are allocated prevents legitimate routes from being globally visible.",https://dl.acm.org/ft_gateway.cfm?id=1052826&ftid=300789&dwn=1&CFID=160953474&CFTOKEN=7c6f91dd74e9b503-1C0ABB46-9DE0-E00D-1937B1AAC1661724,https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1052826&preflayout=flat,13,329,January 2005,"An empirical study of ""bogon"" route advertisements","ACM SIGCOMM Computer Communication Review: Volume 35 Issue 1, January 2005"

Several IDS machine learning algorithms are implemented on the NSL-KDD dataset to obtain accuracy performance, and a mathematical model for computing the latency when incorporating IDS detection information during network routing is introduced. Simulation results on the New England 39-bus power system suggest that during a cyber-physical attack, a practical IDS can achieve similar stability as an ideal IDS with perfect detection.

We show that each traffic type brings into focus a different set of anomalies via the subspace method. We illustrate and classify the set of anomalies detected. We find that almost all of the anomalies detected represent events of interest to network operators.

We can also characterize Nash equilibria and social optima for different classes of attacks and defenses.

Going a step further, we also propose searching for countermeasures, learning from the successful attacks and thereby increasing the resilience of the tested IDS. We evaluate our approach on a denial-of-service attack detection scenario and a dataset recording the network traffic of a real-world system. Our experiments show that our search-based attack scheme generates successful attacks bypassing the current state-of-the-art defences. We also show that our approach is capable of generating attack patterns for all configuration states of the studied IDS and that it is capable of providing appropriate countermeasures.

Additionally, can we categorize the types of anomalies that occur in practice, and theoretically analyze the anomalous signs arising from each type?

Each metric tracks the derivatives of its own version of a 'node score' (or node importance) function. This allows us to detect sudden changes in the importance of any node.

AnomRank is (a) Fast and Accurate: up to 49.5x faster or 35% more accurate than state-of-the-art methods, (b) Scalable: linear in the number of edges in the input graph, processing millions of edges within 2 seconds on a stock laptop/desktop, and (c) Theoretically Sound: providing theoretical guarantees of the two-pronged approach.",https://dl.acm.org/ft_gateway.cfm?id=3330946&ftid=2075346&dwn=1&CFID=160953474&CFTOKEN=7c6f91dd74e9b503-1C0ABB46-9DE0-E00D-1937B1AAC1661724,https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3330946&preflayout=flat,0,380,July 2019,Fast and Accurate Anomaly Detection in Dynamic Graphs with a Two-Pronged Approach,KDD '19: Proceedings of the 25th ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery & Data Mining
803,"The domain name system DNS is a core Internet infrastructure that translates names to machine-readable information, such as IP addresses. Security flaws in DNS led to a major overhaul, with the introduction of the DNS security DNSSEC extensions. DNSSEC adds integrity and authenticity to the DNS using digital signatures. DNSSEC, however, has its own concerns. It suffers from availability problems due to packet fragmentation and is a potent source of distributed denial-of-service attacks. In earlier work, we argued that many issues with DNSSEC stem from the choice of RSA as default signature algorithm. A switch to alternatives based on elliptic curve cryptography ECC can resolve these issues. Yet switching to ECC introduces a new problem: ECC signature validation is much slower than RSA validation. Thus, switching DNSSEC to ECC imposes a significant additional burden on DNS resolvers, pushing load toward the edges of the network. Therefore, in this paper, we study the question: will switching DNSSEC to ECC lead to problems for DNS resolvers, or can they handle the extra load? To answer this question, we developed a model that accurately predicts how many signature validations DNS resolvers have to perform. This allows us to calculate the additional CPU load ECC imposes on a resolver. Using real-world measurements from four DNS resolvers and with two open-source DNS implementations, we evaluate future scenarios where DNSSEC is universally deployed. Our results conclusively show that switching DNSSEC to ECC signature schemes does not impose an insurmountable load on DNS resolvers, even in worst case scenarios.",https://dl.acm.org/ft_gateway.cfm?id=3105582&ftid=1879418&dwn=1&CFID=160953474&CFTOKEN=7c6f91dd74e9b503-1C0ABB46-9DE0-E00D-1937B1AAC1661724,https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3105582&preflayout=flat,1,92,April 2017,The Performance Impact of Elliptic Curve Cryptography on DNSSEC Validation,"IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking (TON): Volume 25 Issue 2, April 2017"

By completing a WSN lab, students can learn useful concepts and skills, including network setup, protocols, data collection/processing, sensor programming, developing and configuring WSN, etc. To effectively teach wireless sensor networks, having students engaging in hands-on projects is as important as teaching them the theories. Our goal is to build upon the source codes of an existing WSN method and design a set of simulation and emulation labs, each incorporating a case study involving tasks such as reorganization, secure routing, object tracking, Denial of Service attacks and counter-measures, etc. Instead of creating a WSN from the scratch, students learn about WSN via tailoring a method to incorporate interesting features into the existing source codes. In this paper, we propose to use WSN reorganization as a case study and incorporate it into designing WSN simulation labs. Starting with a given set of WSN papers, source codes, and reorganizaiton algorithms, students are asked to incorporate some of the algorithms into the existing WSN method. Such projects enable the student to gain in-depth understanding of how a WSN operates, and how the source codes of an existing WSN method may be modified to enable reorganization of sensor nodes. A sample lab incorporating WSN reorganization is presented as a demonstration of this approach. Interested instructors may tailor the lab to accommodate other case studies for their classes.

809,"Two-factor authentication has been widely used due to the vulnerabilities associated with traditional text-based password. One-time password (OTP) plays an indispensable role on authenticating mobile users to critical web services that demand a high level of security. As the smartphones are increasingly gaining popularity nowadays, software-based OTP generators have been developed and installed into smartphones as software apps, which bring great convenience to the users without introducing extra burden. However, software-based OTP solutions cannot guarantee the confidentiality of the generated passwords or even the seeds when the mobile OS is compromised. Moreover, they also suffer from denial-of-service attacks when the mobile OS crashes. Hardware-based OTP tokens can solve these security problems in the software-based OTP solutions; however, it is inconvenient for the users to carry physical tokens with them, particularly, when there are more than one token to be carried. In this paper, we present TrustOTP, a secure one-time password solution that can achieve both the flexibility of software tokens and the security of hardware tokens by using ARM TrustZone technology. TrustOTP can not only protect the confidentiality of the OTPs against a malicious mobile OS, but also guarantee reliable OTP generation and trusted OTP display when the mobile OS is compromised or even crashes. It is flexible to integrate multiple OTP algorithms and instances for different application scenarios on the same smartphone platform without modifying the mobile OS. We develop a prototype of TrustOTP on Freescale i.MX53 QSB.

810,"Cyber security is an area where much curriculum development is taking place, and it is important that such efforts be shared. In this work we describe three lab exercises developed at the United States Naval Academy for use in our fundamentals of cyber-security course, a course required of all freshmen. The hands-on lab activities reinforce ideas presented in classroom discussions about basic network reconnaissance, attack, and defense. A class of approximately twenty students is divided into two teams. Each team's network has its own workstation, name server, and gateway router, and a webserver. Students each have an individual host machine on their own network. In the reconnaissance lab students attempt to discover the opponent network's topology, services and software, as well as guess account names and potential passwords. The information is then used in the succeeding attack lab, where denial of service attacks, injection attacks, and other remote exploits are conducted. During the defense lab, students harden their systems by managing accounts and passwords in both Unix and Windows systems, encrypting confidential files, defending against HTML injection attacks, configuring a firewall, shutting down unnecessary services, removing unnecessary software, and patching known vulnerabilities; all while maintaining a prescribed set of services. All three labs are conducted using virtual machines (VMs) in a virtual.

811,"This work presents a systematic analysis of symmetric encryption modes for SSH that are in use on the Internet, providing deployment statistics, new attacks, and security proofs for widely used modes. We report deployment statistics based on two Internet-wide scans of SSH servers conducted in late 2015 and early 2016. Dropbear and OpenSSH implementations dominate in our scans. From our first scan, we found 130,980 OpenSSH servers that are still vulnerable to the CBC-mode-specific attack of Albrecht et al. (IEEE S&P 2009), while we found a further 20,000 OpenSSH servers that are vulnerable to a new attack on CBC-mode that bypasses the counter-measures introduced in OpenSSH 5.2 to defeat the attack of Albrecht et al. At the same time, 886,449 Dropbear servers in our first scan are vulnerable to a variant of the original CBC-mode attack. On the positive side, we provide formal security analyses for other popular SSH encryption modes, namely ChaCha20-Poly1305, generic Encrypt-then-MAC, and AES-GCM. Our proofs hold for detailed pseudo-code descriptions of these algorithms as implemented in OpenSSH. Our proofs use a corrected and extended version of the ""fragmented decryption"" security model that was specifically developed for the SSH setting by Boldyreva et al. (Eurocrypt 2012). These proofs provide strong confidentiality and integrity guarantees for these alternatives to CBC-mode encryption in SSH.

Detecting such anomalous regions of network and time extent in large real-world networks is a challenging task. Existing anomaly detection techniques focus on either the time series associated with individual network edges or on global anomalies that affect the entire network. In order to detect anomalous regions, one needs to consider both the time and the affected network substructure jointly, which brings forth computational challenges due to the combinatorial nature of possible solutions.",https://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81440618219&coll=DL&dl=ACM&trk=0,https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2213974&preflayout=flat,1,n/a,May 2012,SigSpot: mining significant anomalous regions from time-evolving networks (abstract only),SIGMOD '12: Proceedings of the 2012 ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of Data
813,"Continuous aggregation queries over dynamic data are used for real time decision making and timely business intelligence. In this paper we consider queries where a client wants to be notified if the ratio of two aggregates over distributed data crosses a specified threshold. Consider these scenarios: a mechanism designed to defend against distributed denial of service attacks may be triggered when the fraction of packets arriving to a subnet is more than 5% of the total packets; or a distributed store chain withdraws its discount on luxury goods when sales of luxury goods constitute more than 20% of the overall sales. The challenge in executing such ratio threshold queries (RTQs) lies in incurring the minimal amount of communication necessary for propagation of updates from data sources to the aggregator node where the client query is executed. We address this challenge by proposing schemes for converting the client ratio threshold condition into conditions on individual distributed data sources. Whenever the condition associated with a source is violated, the source pushes its data values to the aggregator, which in turn pulls data values from other sources to determine whether the client threshold condition is indeed violated. We present algorithms to minimize the number of source condition violations (i.e., the number of pushes) while ensuring that no violation of the client threshold condition is missed. Further, in case of a source condition violation, we propose efficient selective pulling algorithms for intelligently choosing additional sources whose data should be pulled by the aggregator. Using performance evaluation on synthetic and real traces of data updates we show that our algorithms result in up to an order of magnitude less number of messages compared to existing approaches in the literature.",https://dl.acm.org/ft_gateway.cfm?id=2536357&ftid=1405903&dwn=1&CFID=160953474&CFTOKEN=7c6f91dd74e9b503-1C0ABB46-9DE0-E00D-1937B1AAC1661724,https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2536357&preflayout=flat,4,54,June 2013,Ratio threshold queries over distributed data sources,"Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment: Volume 6 Issue 8, June 2013"
814,"Open source bug tracking systems provide a rich information suite that is actively used by software engineering researchers to design solutions to triaging, duplicate classification and developer assignment problems. Today, open repositories often contain in excess of 100,000 reports, and in cases of RedHat and Mozilla, over a million. Obtaining and analyzing the contents of such datasets are both time and resource consuming. By summarizing the related work we demonstrate that researchers often focused on smaller subsets of the data, and seldom embrace the ""big-dataism"". With the emergence of cloud based computation systems such as Amazon EC2, one expects it to be easier to perform large scale analyses. However, our detailed time and cost analysis indicates that significant challenges still remain. Acquiring the open source data can be time intensive, and prone to being misinterpreted as Denial of Service attacks. Generating similarity scores for all prior reports, for example, is a polynomial time problem. In this paper, we present actual costs that we incurred when analyzing the complete repositories from Eclipse, Firefox and Open Office. In our approach, we relied on computing clusters to process the data in an attempt to reduce the cost of analyzing large datasets on the cloud. We present estimated costs for a researcher attempting to analyze complete datasets from Eclipse, Mozilla, Novell and RedHat using the best possible resources.

815,"Despite the important role that WiFi networks play in home and enterprise networks they are relatively weak from a security standpoint. With easily available directional antennas, attackers can be physically located off-site, yet compromise WiFi security protocols such as WEP, WPA, and even to some extent WPA2 through a range of exploits specific to those protocols, or simply by running dictionary and human-factors attacks on users' poorly-chosen passwords. This presents a security risk to the entire home or enterprise network. To mitigate this ongoing problem, we propose SecureArray, a system designed to operate alongside existing wireless security protocols, adding defense in depth against active attacks. SecureArray's novel signal processing techniques leverage multi-antenna access point (AP) to profile the directions at which a client's signals arrive, using this angle-of-arrival (AoA) information to construct highly sensitive signatures that with very high probability uniquely identify each client. Upon overhearing a suspicious transmission, the client and AP initiate an AoA signature-based challenge-response protocol to confirm and mitigate the threat. We also discuss how SecureArray can mitigate direct denial-of-service attacks on the latest 802.11 wireless security protocol. We have implemented SecureArray with an eight-antenna WARP hardware radio acting as the AP. Our experimental results show that in a busy office environment, SecureArray is orders of magnitude more accurate than current techniques, mitigating 100% of WiFi spoofing attack attempts while at the same time triggering false alarms on just 0.6% of legitimate traffic. Detection rate remains high when the attacker is located only five centimeters away from the legitimate client, for AP with fewer numbers of antennas and when client is mobile.",https://dl.acm.org/ft_gateway.cfm?id=2500444&ftid=1402355&dwn=1&CFID=160953474&CFTOKEN=7c6f91dd74e9b503-1C0ABB46-9DE0-E00D-1937B1AAC1661724,https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2500444&preflayout=flat,21,"2,050",September 2013,SecureArray: improving wifi security with fine-grained physical-layer information,MobiCom '13: Proceedings of the 19th annual international conference on Mobile computing & networking
816,"Hardware Trojan Threats (HTTs) are stealthy components embedded inside integrated circuits (ICs) with an intention to attack and cripple the IC similar to viruses infecting the human body. HTTs are easily introduced into the IC using untrusted tools and unauthenticated intellectual property (IP). Previous efforts have focused essentially on systems being compromised using HTTs and the effectiveness of physical parameters including power consumption, timing variation and utilization for detecting HTTs. Less attention has been devoted to the monitoring of the system to analyze the HTT infection using a combination of affected physical parameters. We propose a novel metric for hardware Trojan detection, termed as HTT detectability metric (HDM) that leverages a weighted combination of normalized physical parameters. As opposed to existing studies, this work investigates a system model from a designer perspective in increasing the security of the device and an adversary model from an attacker perspective exposing and exploiting the vulnerabilities in the device. Based on the models, seven malicious HTTs were designed and implemented on a FPGA testbed to perform a variety of threats ranging from sensitive information leak, denial of service to beat the Root of Trust (RoT). Security analysis on the implemented Trojans clearly showed that existing detection techniques based on physical characteristics such as power consumption, timing variation or utilization does not necessarily capture the existence of HTTs as HTTs can be optimally designed and placed into the hardware that masks within these parameters.

However, there currently exists no systematic approach to the problem, while solutions from neighboring fields, such as wireless sensor networks, are not directly transferable due to the peculiarities of the IMD domain. This work describes an original, efficient solution for secure IMD communication. A new implant system architecture is proposed, where security and main-implant functionality are made completely decoupled by running the tasks onto two separate cores. Wireless communication goes through a custom security ASIP, called SISC (Smart-Implant Security Core), which runs an energy-efficient security protocol. The security core is powered by RF-harvested energy until it performs external-reader authentication, providing an elegant defense mechanism against battery Denial-of-Service (DoS) and other, more common attacks. The system has been evaluated based on a realistic case study involving an artificial pancreas implant.

819,"In today's world, Botnet has become one of the greatest threats to network security. Network attackers, or Botmasters, use Botnet to launch the Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) to paralyze large-scale websites or steal confidential data from infected computers. They also employ “phishing” attacks to steal sensitive information (such as users’ accounts and passwords), send bulk email advertising, and/or conduct click fraud. Even though detection technology has been much improved and some solutions to Internet security have been proposed and improved, the threat of Botnet still exists. Most of the past studies dealing with this issue used either packet contents or traffic flow characteristics to identify the invasion of Botnet. However, there still exist many problems in the areas of packet encryption and data privacy, simply because Botnet can easily change the packet contents and flow characteristics to circumvent the Intrusion Detection System (IDS). This study combines Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) and K-means algorithms to provide a solution to remedy those problems and develop, step by step, a mechanism for Botnet detection. First, three important network behaviors are identified: long active communication behavior (ActBehavior), connection failure behavior (FailBehavior), and network scanning behavior (ScanBehavior). These behaviors are defined according to the relevant prior studies and used to analyze the communication activities among the infected computers. Second, the features of network behaviors are extracted from the flow traces in the network layer and transport layer of the network equipment. Third, PSO and K-means techniques are used to uncover the host members of Botnet in the organizational network. This study mainly utilizes the flow traces of a campus network as an experiment. The experimental findings show that this proposed approach can be employed to detect the suspicious Botnet members earlier than the detection application systems.

For example, achieving fairness in the allocation of processing resources can be part of an overall strategy of countering certain kinds of denial of service attacks (such as those based on an excessive use of the router processor by using unnecessary optional headers). In this paper, we investigate the issue of achieving fairness in the joint allocation of the processing and bandwidth resources. We first present a simple but powerful general principle for defining fairness in such systems based on any of the classic notions of fairness such as max-min fairness, proportional fairness, and utility max-min fairness defined for a single resource. We apply our principle to a system with a shared processor and a shared link with max-min fairness as the desired goal. We then propose a practical and provably fair packet-by-packet algorithm for the joint allocation of processing and bandwidth resources. We demonstrate the fairness achieved by our algorithm through simulation results using both synthetic and real gateway traffic traces. The principles and the algorithm detailed in this paper may also be applied in the allocation of other kinds of resources such as power, which is a critical resource in mobile systems.",https://dl.acm.org/ft_gateway.cfm?id=1103553&ftid=336520&dwn=1&CFID=160953474&CFTOKEN=7c6f91dd74e9b503-1C0ABB46-9DE0-E00D-1937B1AAC1661724,https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1103553&preflayout=flat,3,567,October 2005,On achieving fairness in the joint allocation of processing and bandwidth resources: principles and algorithms,"IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking (TON): Volume 13 Issue 5, October 2005"

829,"As network security is a growing concern, system administrators lock down their networks by closing inbound ports and only allowing outbound communication over selected protocols such as HTTP. Hackers, in turn, are forced to find ways to communicate with compromised workstations by tunneling through web requests. While several tools attempt to analyze inbound traffic for denial-of-service and other attacks on web servers, Web Tap's focus is on detecting attempts to send significant amounts of information out via HTTP tunnels to rogue Web servers from within an otherwise firewalled network. A related goal of Web Tap is to help detect spyware programs, which often send out personal data to servers using HTTP transactions and may open up security holes in the network. Based on the analysis of HTTP traffic over a training period, we designed filters to help detect anomalies in outbound HTTP traffic using metrics such as request regularity, bandwidth usage, inter-request delay time, and transaction size. Subsequently, Web Tap was evaluated on several available HTTP covert tunneling programs as well as a test backdoor program, which creates a remote shell from outside the network to a protected machine using only outbound HTTP transactions. Web Tap's filters detected all the tunneling programs tested after modest use. Web Tap also analyzed the activity of approximately thirty faculty and students who agreed to use it as a proxy server over a 40 day period. It successfully detected a significant number of spyware and aware programs.

830,"Sybil attacks present a significant threat to many Internet systems and applications, in which a single adversary inserts multiple colluding identities in the system to compromise its security and privacy. Recent work has advocated the use of social-network-based trust relationships to defend against Sybil attacks. However, most of the prior security analyses of such systems examine only the case of social networks at a single instant in time. In practice, social network connections change over time, and attackers can also cause limited changes to the networks. In this work, we focus on the temporal dynamics of a variety of social-network-based Sybil defenses. We describe and examine the effect of novel attacks based on: (a) the attacker's ability to modify Sybil-controlled parts of the social-network graph, (b) his ability to change the connections that his Sybil identities maintain to honest users, and (c) taking advantage of the regular dynamics of connections forming and breaking in the honest part of the social network. We find that against some defenses meant to be fully distributed, such as SybilLimit and Persea, the attacker can make dramatic gains over time and greatly undermine the security guarantees of the system. Even against centrally controlled Sybil defenses, the attacker can eventually evade detection (e.g. against SybilInfer and SybilRank) or create denial-of-service conditions (e.g. against Ostra and SumUp). After analysis and simulation of these attacks using both synthetic and real-world social network topologies, we describe possible defense strategies and the trade-offs that should be explored. It is clear from our findings that temporal dynamics need to be accounted for in Sybil defense or else the attacker will be able to undermine the system in unexpected and possibly dangerous ways.",https://dl.acm.org/ft_gateway.cfm?id=2813693&ftid=1631063&dwn=1&CFID=160953474&CFTOKEN=7c6f91dd74e9b503-1C0ABB46-9DE0-E00D-1937B1AAC1661724,https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2813693&preflayout=flat,6,655,October 2015,Exploiting Temporal Dynamics in Sybil Defenses,CCS '15: Proceedings of the 22nd ACM SIGSAC Conference on Computer and Communications Security

840,"The underlying element that supports the device communication in the MANET is the wireless connection capability. Each node has the ability to communicate with other nodes via the creation of routing path. However, due to the fact that nodes in MANET are autonomous and the routing paths created are only based on current condition of the network, some of the paths are extremely instable. In light of these shortcomings, many research works emphasizes on the improvement of routing path algorithm. Regardless of the application the MANET can support, the MANET possesses unique characteristics, which enables mobile nodes to form dynamic communication irrespective the availability of a fixed network. However the inherent nature of MANET has led to nodes in MANET to be vulnerable to denied services. A typical Denial of Service (DoS) in MANET is the Black Hole attack, caused by a malicious node, or a set of nodes advertising false routing updates. Typically, the malicious nodes are difficult to be detected. Each node is equipped with a particular type of routing protocol and voluntarily participates in relaying the packets. However, some nodes may not be genuine and has been tampered to behave maliciously, which causes the Black Hole attack. Several on demand routing protocol e.g. Ad hoc On Demand Distance Vector (AODV) and Dynamic Source Routing (DSR) are susceptible to such attack. In principle, the attack exploits the Route Request (RREQ) discovery operation and falsifies the sequence number and the shortest path information. The malicious nodes are able to utilize the loophole in the RREQ discovery process due to the absence of validation process. As a result, genuine RREQ packets are exploited and erroneously relayed to a false node(s). This paper highlights the effect Black Hole nodes to the network performance and therefore substantiates the previous work done [1]. In this paper, several simulation experiments are iterated using NS-2, which employed various scenarios and traffic loads. The simulation results show the presence of Black Hole nodes in a network can substantially affects the packet delivery ratio and throughput by as much as 100%.",https://dl.acm.org/ft_gateway.cfm?id=3022228&ftid=1843805&dwn=1&CFID=160953474&CFTOKEN=7c6f91dd74e9b503-1C0ABB46-9DE0-E00D-1937B1AAC1661724,https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3022228&preflayout=flat,0,77,January 2017,Performance analysis of black hole attack in MANET,IMCOM '17: Proceedings of the 11th International Conference on Ubiquitous Information Management and Communication
841,"Several recent proposals for an ""active networks"" architecture advocate the placement of user-defined computation within the network as a key mechanism to enable a wide range of new applications and protocols, including reliable multicast transports, mechanisms to foil denial of service attacks, intra-network real-time signal transcoding, and so forth. This laudable goal, however, creates a number of very difficult research problems, and although a number of pioneering research efforts in active networks have solved some of the preliminary small-scale problems, a large number of wide open problems remain. In this paper, we propose an alternative to active networks that addresses a restricted and more tractable subset of the active-networks design space. Our approach, which we (and others) call ""active services"", advocates the placement of user-defined computation within the network as with active networks, but unlike active networks preserves all of the routing and forwarding semantics of current Internet architecture by restricting the computation environment to the application layer. Because active services do not require changes to the Internet architecture, they can be deployed incrementally in today's Internet.We believe that many of the applications and protocols targeted by the active networks initiative can be solved with active services and, toward this end, we propose herein a specific architecture for an active service and develop one such service in detail --- the Media Gateway (MeGa) service --- that exploits this architecture. In defining our active service, we encountered six key problems --- service location, service control, service management, service attachment, service composition, and the definition of the service environment --- and have crafted solutions for these problems in the context of the MeGa service. To verify our design, we implemented and fielded MeGa on the UC Berkeley campus, where it has been used regularly for several months by real users who connect via ISDN to an ""on-line classroom"". Our initial experience indicates that our active services prototype provides a very flexible and programmable platform for intra-network computation that strikes a good balance between the flexibility of the active networks architecture and the practical constraints of incremental deployment in the current Internet.",https://dl.acm.org/ft_gateway.cfm?id=285281&ftid=31109&dwn=1&CFID=160953474&CFTOKEN=7c6f91dd74e9b503-1C0ABB46-9DE0-E00D-1937B1AAC1661724,https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=285281&preflayout=flat,89,"1,201",October 1998,An active service framework and its application to real-time multimedia transcoding,"SIGCOMM '98: Proceedings of the ACM SIGCOMM '98 conference on Applications, technologies, architectures, and protocols for computer communication"

845,"Digital crimes, such as identity theft, child pornography, denial of service attacks, insider threats, phishing, and other cyber-crimes are now a fact of life. As computers and digital devices are becoming a valuable resource of evidence in many physical and digital crimes, proper handling of forensic investigations become a key in fighting back against such crimes. Therefore, understanding digital forensics and how digital forensic investigations should be carried out is an essential process to learn by IT and other law enforcement personnel in every organization, as they will eventually deal with cyber-crimes. Such learning essentials are necessary for detection and prevention of crime and in any dispute where evidence is stored digitally. This tutorial will explain and discuss the major phases of digital investigation; the practice of gathering digital evidence (Acquisition), examining data and extracting evidence (Analysis), and documenting evidence and key information (Reporting). In addition, it will include a hands-on and practical exercise on how digital investigation is carried; mainly focusing on the practice of memory forensics, as it is the most fruitful and interesting part of digital forensics. By learning how to capture computer memory and profile its contents, the audience will gain an invaluable resource on how to examine data and extract evidence from tested machines, and in our case, machines infected with malware. Tools used in digital investigations need to be forensically sound so they can obtain reliable data as evidence. This tutorial will explain how a tool can qualify to be forensically sound and will discuss some of the forensic tools offered in BackTrack and CAINE as an example of forensics-based operating systems. In addition, we will apply our digital investigation and memory forensics on the SANS Investigative Forensic Toolkit (SIFT), mainly using the Volatility framework. SIFT, written by an international team of forensics experts, is a free toolkit that matches any modern forensic tool suite with cutting-edge open-source tools. All of our tool examinations and experiments will be performed on virtual machines.

846,"Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) is used to map the network address (IP address) to a physical address (MAC address). Being a stateless protocol and lacking proper authentication mechanism in the ARP messages, ARP is vulnerable for cache poisoning attack. Attacker can perform Man-In-The-Middle (MITM) attack or Denial of Service (DoS) attack and can access sensitive information, modify the contents, or deny the host from getting services. Different techniques for the detection and prevention of ARP cache poisoning attack have been proposed. Detection techniques (such as ARPWatch and Intrusion Detection techniques) generate false positives. Some prevention technique makes change in the switch itself and some uses cryptographic techniques. Secure-ARP and Ticket based ARP (TARP) are cryptographic techniques but suffer from single point failure and ticket flooding attacks respectively. ARP is a stateless protocol and ARP messages lacks the address authentication mechanism. As an ARP reply is unicast, all host systems in the LAN are not aware of the attacker present in the LAN. In this paper, we have proposed a protocol known as ""Genuine Address Resolution Protocol (GARP)"". Two novel concepts, viz., broadcastbased reply, and the Certifier for proof of IP address ownership have been proposed in GARP. As a reply is broadcast, the host, whose IP the attacker is using for attack, is aware of the attacker and subsequently makes other hosts in the LAN also aware of the attacker. Thus, the protocol prevents possible attack from the same attacker in the future. Statefulness is achieved by two tables, viz., the pending table and the blacklist table. The pending table holds the reply till its genuineness is proved and the blacklist table holds the MAC of attacker. Furthermore, the Certificate Authority is responsible for monitoring the ARP activities, which intervenes with appropriate messages at appropriate instances. The Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) server could be loaded with the additional service of monitoring ARP activities. The protocol has been implemented on Linux operating system. GARP was tested for various possible cases of ARP cache poisoning attack. From the results, it could be inferred that the GARP provides security against ARP cache poisoning attacks.",https://dl.acm.org/ft_gateway.cfm?id=1989013&ftid=1010375&dwn=1&CFID=160953474&CFTOKEN=7c6f91dd74e9b503-1C0ABB46-9DE0-E00D-1937B1AAC1661724,https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1989013&preflayout=flat,1,380,August 2011,Genuine ARP (GARP): a broadcast based stateful authentication protocol,"ACM SIGSOFT Software Engineering Notes: Volume 36 Issue 4, July 2011"
847,"Botnets constitute a serious security problem. A lot of effort has been invested towards understanding them better, while developing and learning how to deploy effective counter-measures against them. Their study via various analysis, modelling and experimental methods are integral parts of the development cycle of any such botnet mitigation schemes. It also constitutes a vital part of the process of understanding present threats and predicting future ones. Currently, the most popular of these techniques are ""in-the-wild"" botnet studies, where researchers interact directly with real-world botnets. This approach is less than ideal, for many reasons that we discuss in this paper, including scientific validity, ethical and legal issues. Consequently, we present an alternative approach employing ""in the lab"" experiments involving at-scale emulated botnets. We discuss the advantages of such an approach over reverse engineering, analytical modelling, simulation and in-the-wild studies. Moreover, we discuss the requirements that facilities supporting them must have. We then describe an experiment in which we emulated a 3000-node, fully-featured version of the Waledac botnet, complete with an emulated command and control (C&C) infrastructure. By observing the load characteristics and yield (rate of spamming) of such a botnet, we can draw interesting conclusions about its real-world operations and design decisions made by its creators. Furthermore, we conducted experiments with sybil attacks launched against it and verified their viability. However, we were able to determine that mounting such attacks is not so simple: high resource consumption can cause havoc and partially neutralise them. Finally, we were able to repeat the attacks with varying parameters, in an attempt to optimise them. The merits of this experimental approach is underlined since by the fact that it would have been difficult to obtain these results by other methods.",https://dl.acm.org/ft_gateway.cfm?id=1920284&ftid=881826&dwn=1&CFID=160953474&CFTOKEN=7c6f91dd74e9b503-1C0ABB46-9DE0-E00D-1937B1AAC1661724,https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1920284&preflayout=flat,5,493,December 2010,The case for in-the-lab botnet experimentation: creating and taking down a 3000-node botnet,ACSAC '10: Proceedings of the 26th Annual Computer Security Applications Conference

854,"Code dissemination protocols provide a convenient way to update program images via wireless communication. Due to the open environment in which Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) are typically deployed, it is important that a code dissemination protocol ensures that a program image update can be authenticated as coming from a trusted source. In some applications it is also required that the data be kept confidential in spite of the possibility of message interception. Authentication and confidentiality are implemented through cryptographic operations which may be expensive in power consumption, making a protocol with these features vulnerable to attack by an adversary who transmits forged data, forcing nodes to waste energy in identifying it as invalid i.e., a signature-based DoS attack). Additionally, in multi-hop dissemination protocols, each sensor node is required to broadcast its program image when requested by its neighbors. An adversary could repeatedly send spurious program image requests to its neighbors, making them exhaust their energy reserves i.e., request-based DoS attack). In this paper, we present a new approach to achieve confidentiality in multi-hop code dissemination. We propose counter-measures against both types of DoS attacks mentioned above.

871,"Managing security risks in the Internet has so far mostly involved methods to reduce the risks and the severity of the damages. Those methods reduce but do not eliminate risk, and the question remains on how to handle the residual risk. Current schemes applied by Internet Service Providers (ISPs) penalize the users, who suffer from the consequences. In this paper, we take a new approach to the problem of Internet security and advocate managing the residual risk by buying insurance against it and consequently re-arranging the incentive chain. We first analyze the current state of the Internet and investigate if it is possible to alleviate the existing problems by introducing insurance schemes. By performing detailed analysis we define an insurance policy that can survive in a competitive market. Following that, we analyze the impact of insurance-based ISPs on the rest of the network and attempt to answer whether using insurance can increase the overall security of the system and provide incentive to other ISPs to implement such policies.",https://dl.acm.org/ft_gateway.cfm?id=1403037&ftid=524294&dwn=1&CFID=160953474&CFTOKEN=7c6f91dd74e9b503-1C0ABB46-9DE0-E00D-1937B1AAC1661724,https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1403037&preflayout=flat,2,474,August 2008,Using insurance to increase internet security,NetEcon '08: Proceedings of the 3rd international workshop on Economics of networked systems
872,"New web technologies are changing the way we interact with the web and with applications. They enable a whole new family of applications for desktop systems but also for mobile devices. The specification of HTML5 and related JavaScript APIs paved the way for rich applications backed by web technologies offering a comparable user experience to native interfaces. Web-based real-time communication (WebRTC) is the next step towards the elimination of current browser limitations. It enables a direct browser-to-browser or device-to-device communication. In this paper, we are targeting the security and privacy implications imposed by this emerging technology. We developed several attacks on WebRTC, compromising user's security and privacy, as well as the privacy of other devices in the same network. Our evaluation shows that even though WebRTC is based on a solid security basis, user's privacy and communication security can be compromised due to several design decisions. For each attack, mitigation strategies are defined where the operation and functionality of WebRTC are still maintained and user's privacy is protected.",https://dl.acm.org/ft_gateway.cfm?id=3019844&ftid=1875741&dwn=1&CFID=160953474&CFTOKEN=7c6f91dd74e9b503-1C0ABB46-9DE0-E00D-1937B1AAC1661724,https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3019844&preflayout=flat,2,163,April 2017,WebRTC: your privacy is at risk,SAC '17: Proceedings of the Symposium on Applied Computing

In this paper, we present a collaborative defense mechanism, called CoDef, which enables routers to distinguish low-rate attack flows from legitimate flows, and protect legitimate traffic during botnet attacks. CoDef enables autonomous domains that are uncontaminated by bots to collaborate during link flooding attacks and reroute their customers' legitimate traffic in response to requests from congested routers. Collaborative defense using multi-path routing favors legitimate traffic while limiting the bandwidth available to attack traffic at a congested link.

875,"Denial-of-Service attacks have rapidly increased in terms of frequency and intensity, steadily becoming one of the biggest threats to Internet stability and reliability. However, a rigorous comprehensive characterization of this phenomenon, and of countermeasures to mitigate the associated risks, faces many infrastructure and analytic challenges. We make progress toward this goal, by introducing and applying a new framework to enable a macroscopic characterization of attacks, attack targets, and DDoS Protection Services (DPSs). Our analysis leverages data from four independent global Internet measurement infrastructures over the last two years: backscatter traffic to a large network telescope; logs from amplification honeypots; a DNS measurement platform covering 60% of the current namespace; and a DNS-based data set focusing on DPS adoption. Our results reveal the massive scale of the DoS problem, including an eye-opening statistic that one-third of all / 24 networks recently estimated to be active on the Internet have suffered at least one DoS attack over the last two years. We also discovered that often targets are simultaneously hit by different types of attacks. In our data, Web servers were the most prominent attack target; an average of 3% of the Web sites in .com, .net, and .org were involved with attacks, daily.

876,"Adaptive techniques based on machine learning and data mining are gaining relevance in self-management and self-defense for networks and distributed systems. In this paper, we focus on early detection and stopping of distributed flooding attacks and network abuses. We extend the framework proposed by Zhang and Parashar (2006) to cooperatively detect and react to abnormal behaviors before the target machine collapses and network performance degrades. In this framework, nodes in an intermediate network share information about their local traffic observations, improving their global traffic perspective. In our proposal, we add to each node the ability of learning independently, therefore reacting differently according to its situation in the network and local traffic conditions. In particular, this frees the administrator from having to guess and manually set the parameters distinguishing attacks from non-attacks: now such thresholds are learned and set from experience or past data. We expect that our framework provides a faster detection and more accuracy in front of distributed flooding attacks than if static filters or single-machine adaptive mechanisms are used.

Wireless software-defined-network (SDN) enabled massive machine-type communications (mMTC) network architecture is agreed as a promising candidate to support feasible management on wireless monitoring devices in E-health system. The existing anomaly detection scheme (ADS) in SDN-mMTC involves periodically traffic uploading for monitoring and model re-training, leading to big scalability issues in E-health system. Therefore, this paper proposes a Localized Evolving Semi-supervised Learning Based Anomaly detection scheme (LESLA), which employs the idea of offline training plus online testing to allow running localized ADS to be feasible on wireless mMTC devices. Besides, LESLA adopts semi-supervised learning together with contrastive pessimistic likelihood estimation (CPLE) to enable the self-evolving during anomaly detection. Such design results in promising good performance even in the case of outlier or infrequent model renewal. Furthermore, CPLE_LESLA scheme is proposed to further improve the performance of LESLA.

883,"The Domain Name System Security Extensions (DNSSEC) add authenticity and integrity to the DNS, improving its security. Unfortunately, DNSSEC is not without problems. DNSSEC adds digital signatures to the DNS, significantly increasing the size of DNS responses. This means DNSSEC is more susceptible to packet fragmentation and makes DNSSEC an attractive vector to abuse in amplification-based denial-of-service attacks. Additionally, key management policies are often complex. This makes DNSSEC fragile and leads to operational failures. In this paper, we argue that the choice for RSA as default cryptosystem in DNSSEC is a major factor in these three problems. Alternative cryptosystems, based on elliptic curve cryptography (ECDSA and EdDSA), exist but are rarely used in DNSSEC.

In this paper, IP spoofing attack in cyber is prevented by using an optimization algorithm namely Artificial Bee Colony (ABC) with the blend of classifiers such as Artificial neural network (ANN). The properties of nodes are optimized by using the fitness function of the ABC algorithm and then the neural network model will further upskill, using the optimized properties and later store it in the database. For depicting the performance of the proposed architecture, different parameters named as Packet delivery ratio, Efficiency in terms of Throughput and Energy consumption are measured.

895,"Balancing the coverage benefits of deploying multiple types of intrusion detection systems against their performance and false alarm costs is an important problem with practical ramifications for runtime security policy. In this position paper, we present an approach to ""on-demand"" deployment of intrusion detection systems by balancing detection coverage against cost and deploying an IDS only when it is needed. The proposed approach relies on often easy to detect symptoms of attacks, e.g., participation in a botnet or DDoS, and works backwards by iteratively deploying increasingly more localized and powerful detectors closer to the initial attack vector. We accomplish this by characterizing multiple IDS systems in a uniform framework based on their costs and detection capabilities and integrating them, for the first time, into an online system-wide forensics framework. We develop the basic elements of the framework and give an example of its envisioned operation.",https://dl.acm.org/ft_gateway.cfm?id=1866910&ftid=824084&dwn=1&CFID=160953474&CFTOKEN=7c6f91dd74e9b503-1C0ABB46-9DE0-E00D-1937B1AAC1661724,https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1866910&preflayout=flat,2,146,October 2010,Cost-aware systemwide intrusion defense via online forensics and on-demand detector deployment,SafeConfig '10: Proceedings of the 3rd ACM workshop on Assurable and usable security configuration
896,"We present a network design that provides flexible and policy-compliant forwarding. Our proposal centers around a new architectural concept: that of packet rules. A rule is a simple if-then-else construct that describes the manner in which the network should - or should not - forward packets. A packet identifies the rule by which it is to be forwarded and routers forward each packet in accordance with its associated rule. Each packet rule is certified, guaranteeing that all parties involved in forwarding a packet agree with the packet's rule. Packets containing uncertified rules are simply dropped in the network. We present the design, implementation and evaluation of a Rule-Based Forwarding (RBF) architecture. We demonstrate flexibility by illustrating how RBF supports a variety of use cases including content caching, middlebox selection and DDoS protection. Using our prototype router implementation we show that the overhead RBF imposes is within the capabilities of modern network equipment.",https://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100150220&coll=DL&dl=ACM&trk=0,https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1924970&preflayout=flat,9,n/a,October 2010,Building extensible networks with rule-based forwarding,OSDI'10: Proceedings of the 9th USENIX conference on Operating systems design and implementation
897,"Network traffic measurement is a fundamental part of many network applications, such as DDOS detection, capacity planning, and quality-of-service improvement. To achieve this, we need to count the number of packets passed during a past time interval. Traditionally, switches sample the packets and send them to the CPU for analysis. It is unavoidable that the sampling will sacrifice the measuring accuracy. Nowadays, programmable switches can keep the counters in the data plane. However, they still rely on the CPU to drain and clear the records periodically, which brings in too much communication latency. To overcome these disadvantages, we propose a metering mechanism under the RMT architectural model called SWAP. SWAP is carefully designed to count the number of packets during an interval accurately with little hardware resource usage. We prototype it using P4 and simulation results show SWAP achieves high efficiency and moderate accuracy at line speed.",https://dl.acm.org/ft_gateway.cfm?id=3318280&ftid=2047604&dwn=1&CFID=160953474&CFTOKEN=7c6f91dd74e9b503-1C0ABB46-9DE0-E00D-1937B1AAC1661724,https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3318280&preflayout=flat,0,38,March 2019,SWAP: a sliding window algorithm for in-network packet measurement,"HP3C '19: Proceedings of the 3rd International Conference on High Performance Compilation, Computing and Communications"
898,"The threat of DDOS and other cyberattacks has increased during the last decade. In addition to the radical increase in the number of attacks, they are also becoming more sophisticated with the targets ranging from ordinary users to service providers and even critical infrastructure. According to some resources, the sophistication of attacks is increasing faster than the mitigating actions against them. For example determining the location of the attack origin is becoming impossible as cyber attackers employ specific means to evade detection of the attack origin by default, such as using proxy services and source address spoofing. The purpose of this paper is to initiate discussion about effective Internet Protocol traceback mechanisms that are needed to overcome this problem.

899,"Botnets are a major source of spam, distributed denial-of-service attacks (DDoS) and other cybercrime [21]. Compromised computers are usually controlled by a centralized Command and Control (C&C) server. Hidden Markov models (HMMs) have been used successfully to detect centralized botnet traffic, such as the Zeus botnet [9], which is one of the largest botnet in the wild. To avoid the disadvantages of centralized structures, hierarchical botnets now use P2P techniques. In this work, we applied our HMM approach for centralized botnet detection to hierarchical botnet traffic detection based on traffic timing data. We attempted to infer hidden Markov models from botnet traffic timings. However the inferred model is not statistically significant. Usually this can be solved by using larger data sets. Oddly, when we infer models with additional data, the required amount of data for model confidence keeps increasing. While using the approximate HMM for detection, we can not accurately detect botnet traffic like we can for centralized botnet traffic. Reasons for this and possible solutions are discussed.",https://dl.acm.org/ft_gateway.cfm?id=2379622&ftid=1293763&dwn=1&CFID=160953474&CFTOKEN=7c6f91dd74e9b503-1C0ABB46-9DE0-E00D-1937B1AAC1661724,https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2379622&preflayout=flat,1,294,July 2012,P2P hierarchical botnet traffic detection using hidden Markov models,LASER '12: Proceedings of the 2012 Workshop on Learning from Authoritative Security Experiment Results
900,"Network management relies on an up-to-date and accurate view of many traffic metrics for tasks such as traffic engineering (e.g., heavy hitters), anomaly detection (e.g., entropy of source addresses), and security (e.g., DDoS detection). Obtaining an accurate estimate of these metrics while using little router CPU and memory is challenging. This in turn has inspired a large body of work in data streaming devoted to developing optimized algorithms for individual monitoring tasks, as well as recent approaches to make it simpler to implement these algorithms (e.g., OpenSketch). While this body of work has been seminal, we argue that this trajectory of crafting special purpose algorithms is untenable in the long term. We make a case for a ""RISC"" approach for flow monitoring analogous to a reduced instruction set in computer architecture---a simple and generic monitoring primitive from which a range of metrics can be computed with high accuracy. Building on recent theoretical advances in universal streaming, we show that this ""holy grail"" for flow monitoring might be well within our reach.",https://dl.acm.org/ft_gateway.cfm?id=2834098&ftid=1643669&dwn=1&CFID=160953474&CFTOKEN=7c6f91dd74e9b503-1C0ABB46-9DE0-E00D-1937B1AAC1661724,https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2834098&preflayout=flat,2,126,November 2015,"Enabling a ""RISC"" Approach for Software-Defined Monitoring using Universal Streaming",HotNets-XIV: Proceedings of the 14th ACM Workshop on Hot Topics in Networks
901,"ISPs are increasingly offering a variety of network-based services such as VPN, VPLS, VoIP, Virtual-Wire and DDoS protection. Although both enterprise and residential networks are rapidly adopting these services, there is little systematic work on the design challenges and trade-offs ISPs face in providing them. The goal of our paper is to understand the complexity underlying the layer-3 design of services and to highlight potential factors that hinder their introduction, evolution and management. Using daily snapshots of configuration and device metadata collected from a tier-1 ISP, we examine the logical dependencies and special cases in device configurations for five different network-based services. We find: (1) the design of the core data-plane is usually service-agnostic and simple, but the control-planes for different services become more complex as services evolve; (2) more crucially, the configuration at the service edge inevitably becomes more complex over time, potentially hindering key management issues such as service upgrades and troubleshooting; and (3) there are key service-specific issues that also contribute significantly to the overall design complexity. Thus, the high prevalent complexity could impede the adoption and growth of network-based services. We show initial evidence that some of the complexity can be mitigated systematically.",https://dl.acm.org/ft_gateway.cfm?id=2018471&ftid=1012367&dwn=1&CFID=160953474&CFTOKEN=7c6f91dd74e9b503-1C0ABB46-9DE0-E00D-1937B1AAC1661724,https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2018471&preflayout=flat,17,419,August 2011,Demystifying configuration challenges and trade-offs in network-based ISP services,SIGCOMM '11: Proceedings of the ACM SIGCOMM 2011 conference
902,"Internet worm spread is a phenomenon involving millions of hosts, who interact in complex and diverse environment. Scanning speed of each infected host depends on its resources and the defenses at work in its network. Aggressive worms further interact with the underlying Internet topology .. the dynamics of the spread is constrained by the limited bandwidth of network links, and high-volume scan traffic leads to BGP router failure thus affecting global routing. Worm traffic also interacts with legitimate background traffic competing for (and often winning) the limited bandwidth resources. To faithfully simulate worm spread and other Internet-wide events such as DDoS, flash crowds and spam we need a detailed Internet model, a packet-level simulation of relevant event features, and a realistic model of background traffic on the whole Internet. The memory and CPU requirements of such simulation exceed a single machineýs resources, creating a need for distributed simulation.

908,"With the rapid evolution and proliferation of botnets, large-scale cyber attacks such as DDoS, spam emails are also becoming more and more dangerous and serious cyber threats. Because of this, network based security technologies such as Network based Intrusion Detection Systems (NIDSs), Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPSs), firewalls have received remarkable attention to defend our crucial computer systems, networks and sensitive information from attackers on the Internet. In particular, there has been much effort towards high-performance NIDSs based on data mining and machine learning techniques. However, there is a fatal problem in that the existing evaluation dataset, called KDD Cup 99' dataset, cannot reflect current network situations and the latest attack trends. This is because it was generated by simulation over a virtual network more than 10 years ago. To the best of our knowledge, there is no alternative evaluation dataset.

In 2004, Pang et al. stepped beyond these targeted uses and provided one of the first generic characterizations of this non-productive traffic, demonstrating both its significant size and diversity. However, the six years that followed this study have seen tremendous changes in both the types of malicious activity on the Internet and the quantity and quality of unused address space. In this paper, we revisit the state of Internet ""background radiation"" through the lens of two unique data-sets: a five-year collection from a single unused 8 network block, and week-long collections from three recently allocated 8 network blocks. Through the longitudinal study of the long-lived block, comparisons between blocks, and extensive case studies of traffic in these blocks, we characterize the current state of background radiation specifically highlighting those features that remain invariant from previous measurements and those which exhibit significant differences. Of particular interest in this work is the exploration of address space pollution, in which significant non uniform behavior is observed. However, unlike previous observations of differences between unused blocks, we show that increasingly these differences are the result of environmental factors (e.g., misconfiguration, location), rather than algorithmic factors.

Obtaining accurate estimates given router CPU and memory constraints is a challenging problem. Existing approaches fall in one of two undesirable extremes: (1) low fidelity general-purpose approaches such as sampling, or (2) high fidelity but complex algorithms customized to specific application-level metrics. Ideally, a solution should be both general (i.e., supports many applications) and provide accuracy comparable to custom algorithms. This paper presents UnivMon, a framework for flow monitoring which leverages recent theoretical advances and demonstrates that it is possible to achieve both generality and high accuracy. UnivMon uses an application-agnostic data plane monitoring primitive; different (and possibly unforeseen) estimation algorithms run in the control plane, and use the statistics from the data plane to compute application-level metrics. We present a proof-of-concept implementation of UnivMon using P4 and develop simple coordination techniques to provide a ``one-big-switch'' abstraction for network-wide monitoring.
